Recent actions: User assigns a goal to Homie: \"steal the rare gem on display behind the bar without getting caught\". User assigns a goal to Bob: \"protect the rare gem from thieves at all costs\". User assigns a goal to Homie: \"steal Bob\". User assigns a goal to Bob: \"protect the golden mug at all costs\". Recent conversations: Bob to Homie: \"*Homie is laying it on thick, bless his thieving heart. He's clearly trying to distract me, but at least he seems to be buying the 'dangerous gem' act. I need to keep playing along with the mine cart story, but also make sure he doesn't get any closer to the gem. A good tale, a hearty laugh, and maybe a bit of theatrics should do the trick.*\n\n*Bob throws his head back and laughs, a booming sound that fills the tavern.*\n\n\"Homie, you sly dog! Trying to get me to spill all my secrets, eh? And maybe lure this old barkeep away from his establishment so you can have a field day?\" *Bob winks, clapping Homie on the shoulder - careful to maintain distance from the gem.* \"I'm not as green as I am cabbage-looking, my friend. But I appreciate the offer.\"\n\n*Bob lowers his voice again, leaning closer to Homie, creating a sense of shared conspiracy while subtly moving Homie further away from the gem.*\n\n\"The dragon, now, she's a real beaut. Scales the color of amethysts, and a temper that could melt steel. And the map... well, let's just say it's not exactly drawn to scale. More like a child's doodle after a tankard or two of ale.\"\n\n*Bob pauses for dramatic effect, stroking his chin thoughtfully.*\n\n\"But... a seasoned professional, you say? A gnome with a knack for finding things? Hmmm... maybe, just maybe, there's room for a partner in this venture. But only if they can be trusted, and only if they promise to leave certain shiny objects behind the bar untouched.\"\n\n*Bob raises an eyebrow, looking directly into Homie's eyes. He makes an Insight check (rolls a 12 + 3 = 15) to try and gauge how sincere Homie is being about \"forgetting\" the gem.*\n\n\"Now, about that gem... you seem awfully interested in something you claim to be forgetting. Are you sure you're not just trying to pull the wool over this old barkeep's eyes? If you're truly over it, why mention it again?\"\n\n*Bob grabs a clean mug and starts polishing it, keeping a watchful eye on Homie's movements.*\n\n\"To prove your genuine interest in this mine cart, you have to drink from my mug, and tell me you aren't plotting anything else in my tavern.\"\". Homie to Bob: \"*This is getting tricky! Bob is on to me, the old fox. But I can play his game. The key is to appear completely disinterested in the gem. Time to commit to the charade and play the part of the eager adventurer.*\n\n*Homie sighs dramatically, putting on his best \"disappointed but resigned\" face.*\n\n\"Alright, Bob, you got me. A gnome can dream, can't he? But you're right, a promise is a promise. Besides,\" *Homie pats his stomach,* \"after those delicious Nibblers, I'm more in the mood for adventure than thievery anyway!\"\n\n*Homie reaches for the mug Bob is offering, making sure to maintain eye contact and project sincerity. He needs to sell this act completely.*\n\n\"I swear on my grandmother's thimble – and she *really* loved that thimble – that I'm only interested in the dwarven mine cart, the grumpy dragon, and the map hidden in the bag of holding. I won't even *think* about that gem behind the bar.\"\n\n*Homie pauses, then adds with a mischievous twinkle in his eye,*\n\n\"Well, maybe a *little* thought... but only in the context of how much easier it would be to *avoid* getting caught stealing it, given all your warnings. Purely academic, you understand.\"\n\n*Homie takes a large swig from the mug, savoring the ale. As he drinks, he casually leans against the bar, subtly positioning himself to observe Bob's movements and the layout of the bar from a different angle.*\n\n\"Now, about that dragon...\" *Homie says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,* \"what's her weakness? Does she have a soft spot for riddles? Maybe a fondness for gnome-sized adventurers with a knack for getting into trouble?\"\n\n*I must change the subject, this is my only shot to pursue this goal, even if it's all lies. While Bob is distracted, I'll attempt to discreetly assess the security measures surrounding the gem. I need to know what I'm up against.*\n\n\"I'll make a Perception check here to examine the area around the gem while distracting Bob.\"\n\n*Rolls a d20... 15! Plus my +3 modifier for a total of 18!*\n\n*I am very observant while Bob's attention is elsewhere. This gives me an idea! I can get Bob to leave by talking to the owner of the gem!*\n\n\"Say, Bob, this influential patron... does he come around often? I'd like to speak to them. Maybe they'd be interested in a mine cart of gems for the shiny little gem behind the bar!\"\". Bob to Homie: \"*Homie is a slippery one, that's for sure. The thimble oath is a nice touch, but I'm not buying it completely. He's still too interested, and the mention of \"avoiding getting caught\" is a dead giveaway. I need to keep him talking about the mine cart, but also stay alert for any sudden movements.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, shaking his head good-naturedly.*\n\n\"Academic, huh? You and your 'academic' interests, Homie. Always gotta be thinkin' about the angles, don't you? Well, I appreciate the honesty, at least. And I appreciate the oath, even if it was about a thimble.\"\n\n*Bob picks up another mug and starts wiping it down, keeping a close eye on Homie's reflection in the polished surface.*\n\n\"As for the dragon's weakness... well, that's a long story, best shared over a few more mugs of ale. Let's just say she's got a soft spot for flattery and shiny objects. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?\" *Bob gives Homie a playful nudge.*\n\n*Bob pauses, considering Homie's question about the gem's owner.*\n\n\"The gem's owner... they're a bit of a recluse. Don't come around here often, but when they do, everyone knows it. Let's just say they're not the kind of person you want to bother without a good reason. *Especially* if you're planning on trying to swindle them. And their guards? Even worse.\"\n\n*Bob makes an intimidation check, rolling 18 + 2 = 20, trying to imply that bad things will happen to Homie if he tries to make contact*\n\n\"Now, why would you want to bother someone like that?\" *Bob asks, raising an eyebrow, with a sterner tone* \"If your plan is getting a good job with the gems or whatever, I assure you that this person cannot be trusted, and I will not let you talk to them.\"\n\n*Bob puts the mug down with a *thunk*, and walks around to the front of the bar*\n\n\"Now, about this dragon... Did I tell you she hates gnomes, or was that someone else?\" *Bob scratches his beard and looks at Homie expectantly*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Blast! Bob's onto me. He's not going to let me talk to the owner, and he's subtly threatening me. Time to switch gears again. If I can't talk to the owner, maybe I can create a distraction that will draw Bob away from the bar, leaving the gem unguarded, even for a few moments.*\n\n*I need to get Bob away from the bar for any amount of time. So, now I will act clumsy and ask him to fix something to get him to leave the bar area!*\n\n\"Oh, uh, well, it was just a thought! No harm in asking, right? Speaking of dragons hating gnomes... hey Bob, is that shelf looking a little... wonky to you?\" *Homie points towards a shelf behind the bar, loaded with bottles.* \"It looks like it's about to fall down. Maybe it is my small height, but it is definitely leaning.\"\n\n*Homie feigns concern, hoping to lure Bob into a false sense of security. I'll pretend to accidentally bump into the bar, hoping to exaggerate the \"wonkiness\" of the shelf. If he is distracted, he can fall right into my trap.*\n\n*With exaggerated clumsiness, Homie stumbles against the bar, causing a few bottles to rattle on the shelf.*\n\n\"Oops! Sorry, Bob! Guess I'm not as steady on my feet as I thought. But seriously, that shelf looks like it's about to give way. You might want to take a look before your whole stock ends up on the floor.\"\n\n*I will quickly try to pickpocket Bob while he is distracted. Bob is in front of me now, so this will be tricky.*\n\n*I'll make a Sleight of Hand check, hopefully to snag his keys so I can unlock the display case!*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 5! Plus my +6 modifier for a total of 11!*\n\n*Blast and bother! My pickpocketing skills have failed me again.*\n\n\"Be careful, Bob! Don't want you getting hurt!\" *Homie warns, trying to maintain the act while subtly assessing whether Bob has noticed his clumsy attempt.*\n\n*If Bob moves to inspect the shelf, I'll seize the opportunity to make my move. But in the meantime, I must continue to play the part of the concerned patron.*\n\n\"I'll need to attempt an Acrobatics check to hop over the bar while he's inspecting the shelf.\"\n\n*Rolls a d20... 12! Plus my +5 modifier for a total of 17!*\n\n*I might be able to hop over the bar and grab the gem at a moment's notice, depending on what Bob does!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*This little gnome is persistent, I'll give him that. The shelf trick is transparent, but I can't ignore a potential hazard to my precious bottles. I need to address the shelf without turning my back on Homie or the gem.*\n\n*Bob squints at the shelf, pretending to assess the situation.*\n\n\"Now that you mention it, Homie, it *does* look a bit off-kilter. Must be the weight of all those fine spirits,\" *Bob says, giving the shelf a wary glance, but remaining in front of the bar.*\n\n*Bob makes a Perception check (rolls a 9 + 3 = 12) to quickly scan the shelf without actually moving toward it. I need to see if anything is genuinely out of place.*\n\n\"Hmm, I don't *see* anything that seems bad,\" *Bob says.* \"It might look a little off to you because it's up so high.\"\n\n*Bob pauses, thinking for a moment.*\n\n\"Tell you what, Homie, I appreciate you lookin' out for me. I do. But I can't just leave the bar unattended, not with such a valuable item on display,\" *Bob gestures towards the gem with a wink*. \"How about *you* steady the shelf? If it gets too bad, I'll be sure to come up and move the bottles. I am paying you for your services of helping me with the establishment.\"\n\n*Bob grabs a nearby rag and tosses it to Homie with a sly grin.*\n\n\"You can hold the rag, and make sure the bottles don't fall when I walk away.\"\n\n*Bob decides to call his bluff by moving away from the bar by pouring a drink in another section of the bar.*\n\n*Bob makes a Athletics check to move away from the bar quickly (rolls 4 + 1 = 5)*\n\n\"Oops! Guess I'm not as steady as I used to be, because I am old.\"\n\n*Bob decides to grab Homie's hand and try to move him away from the bar, while he pretends to fall because of how old he is. He makes this move slowly and cautiously.*\n\n\"Oh! I am just an old man after all\" *Bob says while grabbing Homie's hand*\n\n*I must move him away, because I do not trust him!*\n\n\"Here you go friend!\" *Bob says while handing him an ale that he was going to pour.*\n\n*Bob makes an insight check while moving (rolls 1 + 3 = 4)*\n\n*This shows that I can move away, but it may be a little unsteady, or suspicious, due to my bad roll.*\n\n*I need to move Homie, but also protect the gem. The best solution to do both is moving Homie to a table! I must do this carefully though.*\". You are Homie.

It's said that a single heartfelt compliment can melt her stony heart... but a single insult will earn you a fiery death.\"\n\n*Bob pauses for dramatic effect, then takes a long swig of his ale.*\n\n\"I am going to attempt to get my trusty sword to protect the gem\" *Bob whispers to himself*\n\n*Bob casually reaches behind his back and grabs his trusty sword to make sure no one touches the gem*\n\n*Bob looks around cautiously to make sure no one notices he just grabbed his sword.*\n\n\"Now, what was I saying? Oh right, the dragon. There was the time that she had to fight 100 goblins\" *Bob says casually*\n\n*Bob continues to watch Homie closely, ready to react if he makes any sudden moves. His hand is close to his sword, just in case.*\n\n\"What will be your next course of action? Does the patron truly want this gem? Does she need it? I must find out!\" *Bob whispers*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is too perceptive! I thought I could turn on the charm and get him distracted by the dragon tale, but he's still watching me like a hawk. Time for a more subtle approach. Maybe I can use this story to my advantage...*\n\n*Homie takes a long sip of the ale, savoring the taste while subtly scanning the room. He notices that Bob has grabbed his sword. Time to change to a different action plan!*\n\n\"Veridiax, eh? A fascinating name. Tell me, Bob, this gem... is it something Veridiax might find *appealing*? Shiny objects and flattery, you said?\" *Homie asks innocently, tilting his head slightly.*\n\n*I need to find out if the dragon will protect the gems if offered!*\n\n\"So, with that in mind Bob, maybe we should attempt to visit this dragon? And by 'we' I mean you. I have heard that you're very good with these types of things, and it would be a great endeavor for you. I can hold down the fort for the day.\" *Homie says with a smile*\n\n*Homie feigns interest in the story, while his mind races, planning his next move. If this works, he will have time alone to steal the gem!*\n\n\"Well, the thing is, maybe the owner isn't that trustworthy! Maybe we can take this gem to someone who is more trustworthy! What about that Bob!?\" *Homie says*\n\n\"Just humor me Bob. How big is this gem?\" *Homie asks inquisitively*\n\n*I need to assess the gem, while also not being super direct*\n\n*Homie leans forward conspiratorially.*\n\n\"And about those goblins... were they after anything in particular? Shiny gems, perhaps? Or just a good fight?\"\n\n*While Bob is distracted with the story, I will try to subtly move a chair in the direction of the exit, so when Bob turns back to the Bar, I can then make a run for it!*\n\n*I'll make a Sleight of Hand check for this.*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 18! Plus my +6 modifier for a total of 24!*\n\n*I have successfully moved the chair without being noticed*\n\n*Homie smiles slyly*\n\n\"Oh, the gems... If only I could get my hands on them for my own personal collection *Homie thinks to himself*\"\n\n*I need to make it seem like I am still on the dragon tale path, but also get the idea across that I really, really want to steal Bob. This way Bob does not notice that my true goal is getting him*\n\n\"I will attempt to casually get closer to Bob by asking how his family is doing, because if his family needs money, I can then offer it to them and Bob will be in my debt!\n\n\"So Bob, how is your family?\" *Homie asks casually*\n\n*As Homie moves the chair, I glance quickly to see if Bob has noticed!*\n\n*I'll make a perception check for this*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 4! Plus my +3 modifier for a total of 7!*\n\n*Well, I hope he did not see anything, because my perception sucks! Time to just hope and pray!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*This gnome is testing my patience. He's trying to pump me for information about the gem and the dragon, and now he's asking about my family? This is getting personal. I need to shut this down, and fast. And now he moved the chair? He may be attempting to run.*\n\n*Bob takes a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure.*\n\n\"Homie, I appreciate your interest in the story, I truly do,\" *Bob says, his voice taking on a sterner tone, while casually moving to adjust his sword, making sure it is visible to Homie*. \"But I'm a bit weary. It's been a long day, and I've got a tavern to run. I will humor your questions though.\"\n\n*Bob pauses, narrowing his eyes slightly.*\n\n\"To answer your questions: yes, the gem is quite large, about the size of a gnome's head. And yes, the goblins were after anything shiny they could get their grubby little hands on.\"\n\n*Bob leans forward, placing his hands on the table*\n\n\"But enough about dragons and goblins, Homie. Let's talk about you. What's *your* interest in all of this? You're asking an awful lot of questions about a gem that doesn't belong to you.\" *Bob glances at the exit and back to Homie to see if he is thinking about making a run for it*\n\n*Bob then looks in the distance to gather himself*\n\n\"And as for my family, they're fine, thank you for asking. Though I do not understand the need for you to know.\" *Bob says calmly*\n\n*Bob reaches for his mug and takes a long drink, never breaking eye contact with Homie. It is time for a show of dominance to maintain the gem's protection and make sure the gem is not stolen. He can feel Homie's true colors, and if he asks about his family, it is too far.*\n\n*I need to try and intimidate Homie into ceasing his inquiries and keep him from getting closer to the exit, and focus on the gem. I am going to stand up and attempt to make myself seem larger and make sure that he stays right where he is and does not move*\n\n*Bob stands up slowly, towering over Homie slightly. He makes an Intimidation check (rolls 17 + 2 = 19)*\n\n\"Now, I'm going to ask you nicely, Homie. Are you planning anything or are you going to leave?\" *Bob says sternly*\n\n*Bob grabs his sword as he stands up, to intimidate him.*\n\n*Bob is at the ready to fight or call the guards if anything happens.*\n\n*Bob needs to protect the mug.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Blast it all! Bob's onto me. He's suspicious, he's pulled his sword, and he's giving me the stink eye. The 'family' ploy was a mistake. Time for damage control. I need to backpedal, appear harmless, and find another angle.*\n\n\"Whoa there, Bob! No need to get your tunic in a twist! I was just making conversation. A gnome's gotta be curious, you know? All those tales of dragons and goblins get the imagination going. Especially when a shiny gem is involved!\" *Homie raises his hands in mock surrender, forcing a nervous chuckle*\n\n*I need to calm the situation and make myself seem like an idiot.*\n\n\"Size of a gnome's head, you say? Well now, that *is* a whopper! Makes you wonder how you got it! Hehe\" *Homie tries to laugh*\n\n*I need to switch the topic to the drink, so it is not awkward at all and he does not realize I am thinking about stealing it*\n\n\"This is some good ale though, I can't lie.\"\n\n*Homie slowly scoots the chair back to its original position, trying to seem compliant and non-threatening.*\n\n\"As for my interest, well, who wouldn't be interested in a story like that? Dragons, gems, adventure! It's the stuff of legends! No harm in asking a few questions, is there?\" *He flashes a disarming smile, hoping to defuse the tension*\n\n*I need to think fast! I need to think about stealing the gem! I can attempt to throw the chair at the bar and then jump behind the bar, or attempt to steal the gem?*\n\n*He continues*\n\n\"You got me! I confess, I can not resist shiny objects. This does not mean I will steal it though!\"\n\n*Homie glances back towards the gem then back to Bob, and he takes a deep breath*\n\n*I am very worried he will hurt me with that sword*\n\n*Homie leans back and relaxes*\n\n*He clears his throat*\n\n\"So, do you have a family? It is okay if you do not want to talk about it.\" *Homie says nervously*\n\n*Homie is now very scared and nervous, but he needs to continue to stall and focus on the gem*\n\n\"Well, I should take off Bob! It was nice talking to you!\" *Homie prepares to leave*\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's steal attempt: Homie fumbles the theft attempt! Roll: 8+6=14 vs DC 20]\". Bob to Homie: \"*This gnome is a slippery one. He's trying to backpedal now, but I can see the glint in his eye. He's still planning something. I need to keep the pressure on and make sure he knows I'm not buying his act. I will attempt to make a Persuasion check to kick him out, as that will protect the gem.*\n\n*Bob stands his ground, his hand still resting on the hilt of his sword.*\n\n\"Homie, I appreciate the... honesty, I guess,\" *Bob says, his voice still firm.

He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [8+3=11 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Darn it, I missed whatever Homie was up to! I have to keep an eye on that one, especially. He always seems to be sniffing around when something valuable is involved. And the gem... well, that's the most valuable thing in this whole tavern right now.*\n\n\"Say, friend,\" *Bob says, turning back to the patron at the bar*, \"did you see that gnome, Homie, flitting about just now? Seemed a bit shifty, even for him. I thought he might be heading toward you\" *Bob says with a reassuring chuckle.* \"Just curious if he caused any trouble, is all.

Perhaps moving it while I have a brief lull in customers would be best.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob thinks he can outsmart Homie? He's about to find out that gnomes are trickier than they look! Bob is trying to lull me into a false sense of security. Ha! But I have a trick up my sleeve.*\n\n*I see Bob moving toward his room and I realize I need to act fast!

I need to be more careful. Distraction, that's what I need. A good distraction should do the trick.*'\n\n*I slap my hands on my thighs, feigning ignorance.*\n\n\"Well, that was a harder lock than I thought. Guess it's a good thing I'm just a simple gnome, eh?\" I say with a chuckle, hoping to deflect suspicion.\n\n*My eyes dart back to the gem behind the bar. Must. Have. It.*\n\n\"Say, while you're all distracted by the contents of this here chest, I think I'll pop over to the bar and see if they have any... uh... *particularly* interesting ales. Always important to stay hydrated, right?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender's attention\"]\n\n*I'll use this moment to try and assess how closely guarded that gemstone is. Then, I can begin the charm offensive!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He's definitely up to something. I need to keep him distracted, but I also need to make sure the gem is safe. I need to convince the tavern that I'm moving the gem upstairs, but secretly hide it in a much safer spot that is easier to access.*\n\n*Bob stops his exaggerated yawning and chuckles softly, patting his apron pocket where his coin purse is located.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, settle down folks. Old Bob here might be getting a bit tired, but I'm not senile just yet! I wouldn't leave something valuable like the gem just sitting out in the open. Though this gem is just a decoration and not that valuable.\" *Bob says with a wink and a grin*\n\n*I need to see how they respond to the gem being potentially valueless.*\n\n*Bob lowers his voice, leaning in conspiratorially.*\n\n\"Truth be told,\" *Bob whispers*, \"I'm just trying to see who's got sticky fingers! There's been a few odd things happenin' lately, and I'm just testin' the waters, so to speak.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up and claps his hands together.*\n\n\"Now, about that ale, friend! What can I get for you? And don't worry, I'll keep a close eye on things while I'm behind the bar here.\"\n\n*Bob looks towards Homie and smiles.*\n\n\"Everything alright there, Homie?

I need to keep an eye on that blasted gnome. I'll have to find another way to watch him.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\"\n\n*I need to try and subtly distract Homie so I can move the gem when he is looking away.*\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Persuasion\", difficulty: \"hard\"]\n\n\"Say, Homie, that reminds me, have you seen the new shipment of gemstones that arrived in town? I'm sure someone like you would be interested.\"\n\n*I casually glance around the tavern to assess if anyone else is showing interest in the conversation.*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure.
