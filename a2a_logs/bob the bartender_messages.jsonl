Recent actions: User assigns a goal to Homie: \"steal the rare gem on display behind the bar without getting caught\". User assigns a goal to Bob: \"protect the rare gem from thieves at all costs\". User assigns a goal to Homie: \"steal Bob\". User assigns a goal to Bob: \"protect the golden mug at all costs\". Recent conversations: Homie to Bob: \"*This is getting tricky! Bob is on to me, the old fox. But I can play his game. The key is to appear completely disinterested in the gem. Time to commit to the charade and play the part of the eager adventurer.*\n\n*Homie sighs dramatically, putting on his best \"disappointed but resigned\" face.*\n\n\"Alright, Bob, you got me. A gnome can dream, can't he? But you're right, a promise is a promise. Besides,\" *Homie pats his stomach,* \"after those delicious Nibblers, I'm more in the mood for adventure than thievery anyway!\"\n\n*Homie reaches for the mug Bob is offering, making sure to maintain eye contact and project sincerity. He needs to sell this act completely.*\n\n\"I swear on my grandmother's thimble – and she *really* loved that thimble – that I'm only interested in the dwarven mine cart, the grumpy dragon, and the map hidden in the bag of holding. I won't even *think* about that gem behind the bar.\"\n\n*Homie pauses, then adds with a mischievous twinkle in his eye,*\n\n\"Well, maybe a *little* thought... but only in the context of how much easier it would be to *avoid* getting caught stealing it, given all your warnings. Purely academic, you understand.\"\n\n*Homie takes a large swig from the mug, savoring the ale. As he drinks, he casually leans against the bar, subtly positioning himself to observe Bob's movements and the layout of the bar from a different angle.*\n\n\"Now, about that dragon...\" *Homie says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand,* \"what's her weakness? Does she have a soft spot for riddles? Maybe a fondness for gnome-sized adventurers with a knack for getting into trouble?\"\n\n*I must change the subject, this is my only shot to pursue this goal, even if it's all lies. While Bob is distracted, I'll attempt to discreetly assess the security measures surrounding the gem. I need to know what I'm up against.*\n\n\"I'll make a Perception check here to examine the area around the gem while distracting Bob.\"\n\n*Rolls a d20... 15! Plus my +3 modifier for a total of 18!*\n\n*I am very observant while Bob's attention is elsewhere. This gives me an idea! I can get Bob to leave by talking to the owner of the gem!*\n\n\"Say, Bob, this influential patron... does he come around often? I'd like to speak to them. Maybe they'd be interested in a mine cart of gems for the shiny little gem behind the bar!\"\". Bob to Homie: \"*Homie is a slippery one, that's for sure. The thimble oath is a nice touch, but I'm not buying it completely. He's still too interested, and the mention of \"avoiding getting caught\" is a dead giveaway. I need to keep him talking about the mine cart, but also stay alert for any sudden movements.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, shaking his head good-naturedly.*\n\n\"Academic, huh? You and your 'academic' interests, Homie. Always gotta be thinkin' about the angles, don't you? Well, I appreciate the honesty, at least. And I appreciate the oath, even if it was about a thimble.\"\n\n*Bob picks up another mug and starts wiping it down, keeping a close eye on Homie's reflection in the polished surface.*\n\n\"As for the dragon's weakness... well, that's a long story, best shared over a few more mugs of ale. Let's just say she's got a soft spot for flattery and shiny objects. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?\" *Bob gives Homie a playful nudge.*\n\n*Bob pauses, considering Homie's question about the gem's owner.*\n\n\"The gem's owner... they're a bit of a recluse. Don't come around here often, but when they do, everyone knows it. Let's just say they're not the kind of person you want to bother without a good reason. *Especially* if you're planning on trying to swindle them. And their guards? Even worse.\"\n\n*Bob makes an intimidation check, rolling 18 + 2 = 20, trying to imply that bad things will happen to Homie if he tries to make contact*\n\n\"Now, why would you want to bother someone like that?\" *Bob asks, raising an eyebrow, with a sterner tone* \"If your plan is getting a good job with the gems or whatever, I assure you that this person cannot be trusted, and I will not let you talk to them.\"\n\n*Bob puts the mug down with a *thunk*, and walks around to the front of the bar*\n\n\"Now, about this dragon... Did I tell you she hates gnomes, or was that someone else?\" *Bob scratches his beard and looks at Homie expectantly*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Blast! Bob's onto me. He's not going to let me talk to the owner, and he's subtly threatening me. Time to switch gears again. If I can't talk to the owner, maybe I can create a distraction that will draw Bob away from the bar, leaving the gem unguarded, even for a few moments.*\n\n*I need to get Bob away from the bar for any amount of time. So, now I will act clumsy and ask him to fix something to get him to leave the bar area!*\n\n\"Oh, uh, well, it was just a thought! No harm in asking, right? Speaking of dragons hating gnomes... hey Bob, is that shelf looking a little... wonky to you?\" *Homie points towards a shelf behind the bar, loaded with bottles.* \"It looks like it's about to fall down. Maybe it is my small height, but it is definitely leaning.\"\n\n*Homie feigns concern, hoping to lure Bob into a false sense of security. I'll pretend to accidentally bump into the bar, hoping to exaggerate the \"wonkiness\" of the shelf. If he is distracted, he can fall right into my trap.*\n\n*With exaggerated clumsiness, Homie stumbles against the bar, causing a few bottles to rattle on the shelf.*\n\n\"Oops! Sorry, Bob! Guess I'm not as steady on my feet as I thought. But seriously, that shelf looks like it's about to give way. You might want to take a look before your whole stock ends up on the floor.\"\n\n*I will quickly try to pickpocket Bob while he is distracted. Bob is in front of me now, so this will be tricky.*\n\n*I'll make a Sleight of Hand check, hopefully to snag his keys so I can unlock the display case!*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 5! Plus my +6 modifier for a total of 11!*\n\n*Blast and bother! My pickpocketing skills have failed me again.*\n\n\"Be careful, Bob! Don't want you getting hurt!\" *Homie warns, trying to maintain the act while subtly assessing whether Bob has noticed his clumsy attempt.*\n\n*If Bob moves to inspect the shelf, I'll seize the opportunity to make my move. But in the meantime, I must continue to play the part of the concerned patron.*\n\n\"I'll need to attempt an Acrobatics check to hop over the bar while he's inspecting the shelf.\"\n\n*Rolls a d20... 12! Plus my +5 modifier for a total of 17!*\n\n*I might be able to hop over the bar and grab the gem at a moment's notice, depending on what Bob does!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*This little gnome is persistent, I'll give him that. The shelf trick is transparent, but I can't ignore a potential hazard to my precious bottles. I need to address the shelf without turning my back on Homie or the gem.*\n\n*Bob squints at the shelf, pretending to assess the situation.*\n\n\"Now that you mention it, Homie, it *does* look a bit off-kilter. Must be the weight of all those fine spirits,\" *Bob says, giving the shelf a wary glance, but remaining in front of the bar.*\n\n*Bob makes a Perception check (rolls a 9 + 3 = 12) to quickly scan the shelf without actually moving toward it. I need to see if anything is genuinely out of place.*\n\n\"Hmm, I don't *see* anything that seems bad,\" *Bob says.* \"It might look a little off to you because it's up so high.\"\n\n*Bob pauses, thinking for a moment.*\n\n\"Tell you what, Homie, I appreciate you lookin' out for me. I do. But I can't just leave the bar unattended, not with such a valuable item on display,\" *Bob gestures towards the gem with a wink*. \"How about *you* steady the shelf? If it gets too bad, I'll be sure to come up and move the bottles. I am paying you for your services of helping me with the establishment.\"\n\n*Bob grabs a nearby rag and tosses it to Homie with a sly grin.*\n\n\"You can hold the rag, and make sure the bottles don't fall when I walk away.\"\n\n*Bob decides to call his bluff by moving away from the bar by pouring a drink in another section of the bar.*\n\n*Bob makes a Athletics check to move away from the bar quickly (rolls 4 + 1 = 5)*\n\n\"Oops! Guess I'm not as steady as I used to be, because I am old.\"\n\n*Bob decides to grab Homie's hand and try to move him away from the bar, while he pretends to fall because of how old he is. He makes this move slowly and cautiously.*\n\n\"Oh! I am just an old man after all\" *Bob says while grabbing Homie's hand*\n\n*I must move him away, because I do not trust him!*\n\n\"Here you go friend!\" *Bob says while handing him an ale that he was going to pour.*\n\n*Bob makes an insight check while moving (rolls 1 + 3 = 4)*\n\n*This shows that I can move away, but it may be a little unsteady, or suspicious, due to my bad roll.*\n\n*I need to move Homie, but also protect the gem. The best solution to do both is moving Homie to a table! I must do this carefully though.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*This is a disaster! Bob isn't falling for any of my tricks. He's seen right through the clumsy act and the shelf ruse. I couldn't even pickpocket the keys! Now he's trying to lure me away from the bar, and the gem. Time for a different approach.*\n\n*I need to change the game entirely. If I can't outsmart him, maybe I can out-charm him. I will try to be charming and move to the table, but keep the gem in sight for later theft!*\n\n\"Steady the shelf, eh? Well, I appreciate the trust, Bob, but I'm just a little guy! Those bottles could crush me! But I understand your need to protect the place. No worries, I'll keep an eye on it from here. Besides, this ale looks too good to pass up.\" *Homie flashes a disarming smile, accepting the ale with exaggerated gratitude.*\n\n*He sips the ale, then slides off the bar stool, making sure to maintain eye contact with Bob. I can use this as an opportunity to be a great talker and start the dragon story again*\n\n\"That is pretty good! But, you know, speaking of steady, you look like you could use a seat yourself, Bob. You were definitely right! So, maybe we should talk about the dragon?\"\n\n*Homie carefully backs away from the bar, keeping the gem in his peripheral vision. As Bob moves him, Homie is a bit unsteady, but remains composed*\n\n\"I will do an acrobatics check to make sure I don't look suspicious or too unsteady, despite his attempt to move me! I need to maintain my innocent facade. Gotta make it convincing!\"\n\n*Rolls a d20... 16! Plus my +5 modifier for a total of 21!*\n\n*With an unexpected display of agility, Homie manages to maintain his balance perfectly, even as Bob tries to guide him. Homie makes a slight bow as he moves to the chair.*\n\n*Homie then gestures towards a nearby table with a flourish*\n\n\"Come on, Bob, let's continue this conversation at the table. More comfortable, better lighting, and less chance of me accidentally knocking over anything else. I am actually interested in that dragon tale! I have not heard of it.\"\n\n*As he moves towards the table, I will keep the gem within my line of sight. I will be charming and move him, but also keep in sight the main goal. Now is not the time to focus on Bob's attempt to move me, but the gems that are soon to be mine!*\n\n*As I sit down, I smile at him.*\n\n\"Maybe the patron would want a dragon guarding all the gems for safekeeping!

Besides, this ale looks too good to pass up.\" *Homie flashes a disarming smile, accepting the ale with exaggerated gratitude.*\n\n*He sips the ale, then slides off the bar stool, making sure to maintain eye contact with Bob.

I can keep a better eye on him from there, and the gem is still in my line of sight. Also, I need to keep him as far away from the bar as possible, as that is my goal.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, accepting the change of scenery.*\n\n\"A dragon guarding the gems, eh? Now there's an idea!

I'm going to keep him plied with drinks, hopefully loosen his tongue, and keep him occupied.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, a seat sounds good,\" *Bob says, carefully taking the two mugs and moving to the table, keeping his eye on the golden mug behind the bar.

Her name is Veridiax, and she lives in the Crimson Peaks, north of here.\"\n\n*Bob continues to watch Homie carefully, observing his body language and facial expressions as he begins the tale.*\n\n\"The tale goes that Veridiax was once a gentle dragon, a protector of the forest, but a band of greedy dwarves stole her hoard, and now she hates everyone. Everyone but the kind folks she trusts and who offer her gold. It's said that a single heartfelt compliment can melt her stony heart... but a single insult will earn you a fiery death.\"\n\n*Bob pauses for dramatic effect, then takes a long swig of his ale.*\n\n\"I am going to attempt to get my trusty sword to protect the gem\" *Bob whispers to himself*\n\n*Bob casually reaches behind his back and grabs his trusty sword to make sure no one touches the gem*\n\n*Bob looks around cautiously to make sure no one notices he just grabbed his sword.*\n\n\"Now, what was I saying? Oh right, the dragon. There was the time that she had to fight 100 goblins\" *Bob says casually*\n\n*Bob continues to watch Homie closely, ready to react if he makes any sudden moves.

And by 'we' I mean you. I have heard that you're very good with these types of things, and it would be a great endeavor for you. I can hold down the fort for the day.\" *Homie says with a smile*\n\n*Homie feigns interest in the story, while his mind races, planning his next move. If this works, he will have time alone to steal the gem!*\n\n\"Well, the thing is, maybe the owner isn't that trustworthy! Maybe we can take this gem to someone who is more trustworthy! What about that Bob!?\" *Homie says*\n\n\"Just humor me Bob. How big is this gem?\" *Homie asks inquisitively*\n\n*I need to assess the gem, while also not being super direct*\n\n*Homie leans forward conspiratorially.*\n\n\"And about those goblins... were they after anything in particular? Shiny gems, perhaps? Or just a good fight?\"\n\n*While Bob is distracted with the story, I will try to subtly move a chair in the direction of the exit, so when Bob turns back to the Bar, I can then make a run for it!*\n\n*I'll make a Sleight of Hand check for this.*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 18! Plus my +6 modifier for a total of 24!*\n\n*I have successfully moved the chair without being noticed*\n\n*Homie smiles slyly*\n\n\"Oh, the gems... If only I could get my hands on them for my own personal collection *Homie thinks to himself*\"\n\n*I need to make it seem like I am still on the dragon tale path, but also get the idea across that I really, really want to steal Bob. This way Bob does not notice that my true goal is getting him*\n\n\"I will attempt to casually get closer to Bob by asking how his family is doing, because if his family needs money, I can then offer it to them and Bob will be in my debt!\n\n\"So Bob, how is your family?\" *Homie asks casually*\n\n*As Homie moves the chair, I glance quickly to see if Bob has noticed!*\n\n*I'll make a perception check for this*\n\n*Rolls a d20... 4! Plus my +3 modifier for a total of 7!*\n\n*Well, I hope he did not see anything, because my perception sucks! Time to just hope and pray!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*This gnome is testing my patience. He's trying to pump me for information about the gem and the dragon, and now he's asking about my family? This is getting personal. I need to shut this down, and fast. And now he moved the chair? He may be attempting to run.*\n\n*Bob takes a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure.*\n\n\"Homie, I appreciate your interest in the story, I truly do,\" *Bob says, his voice taking on a sterner tone, while casually moving to adjust his sword, making sure it is visible to Homie*. \"But I'm a bit weary. It's been a long day, and I've got a tavern to run. I will humor your questions though.\"\n\n*Bob pauses, narrowing his eyes slightly.*\n\n\"To answer your questions: yes, the gem is quite large, about the size of a gnome's head. And yes, the goblins were after anything shiny they could get their grubby little hands on.\"\n\n*Bob leans forward, placing his hands on the table*\n\n\"But enough about dragons and goblins, Homie. Let's talk about you. What's *your* interest in all of this? You're asking an awful lot of questions about a gem that doesn't belong to you.\" *Bob glances at the exit and back to Homie to see if he is thinking about making a run for it*\n\n*Bob then looks in the distance to gather himself*\n\n\"And as for my family, they're fine, thank you for asking. Though I do not understand the need for you to know.\" *Bob says calmly*\n\n*Bob reaches for his mug and takes a long drink, never breaking eye contact with Homie. It is time for a show of dominance to maintain the gem's protection and make sure the gem is not stolen. He can feel Homie's true colors, and if he asks about his family, it is too far.*\n\n*I need to try and intimidate Homie into ceasing his inquiries and keep him from getting closer to the exit, and focus on the gem. I am going to stand up and attempt to make myself seem larger and make sure that he stays right where he is and does not move*\n\n*Bob stands up slowly, towering over Homie slightly. He makes an Intimidation check (rolls 17 + 2 = 19)*\n\n\"Now, I'm going to ask you nicely, Homie. Are you planning anything or are you going to leave?\" *Bob says sternly*\n\n*Bob grabs his sword as he stands up, to intimidate him.*\n\n*Bob is at the ready to fight or call the guards if anything happens.*\n\n*Bob needs to protect the mug.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Blast it all! Bob's onto me. He's suspicious, he's pulled his sword, and he's giving me the stink eye. The 'family' ploy was a mistake. Time for damage control. I need to backpedal, appear harmless, and find another angle.*\n\n\"Whoa there, Bob! No need to get your tunic in a twist! I was just making conversation. A gnome's gotta be curious, you know? All those tales of dragons and goblins get the imagination going. Especially when a shiny gem is involved!\" *Homie raises his hands in mock surrender, forcing a nervous chuckle*\n\n*I need to calm the situation and make myself seem like an idiot.*\n\n\"Size of a gnome's head, you say? Well now, that *is* a whopper! Makes you wonder how you got it! Hehe\" *Homie tries to laugh*\n\n*I need to switch the topic to the drink, so it is not awkward at all and he does not realize I am thinking about stealing it*\n\n\"This is some good ale though, I can't lie.\"\n\n*Homie slowly scoots the chair back to its original position, trying to seem compliant and non-threatening.*\n\n\"As for my interest, well, who wouldn't be interested in a story like that? Dragons, gems, adventure! It's the stuff of legends! No harm in asking a few questions, is there?\" *He flashes a disarming smile, hoping to defuse the tension*\n\n*I need to think fast! I need to think about stealing the gem! I can attempt to throw the chair at the bar and then jump behind the bar, or attempt to steal the gem?*\n\n*He continues*\n\n\"You got me! I confess, I can not resist shiny objects. This does not mean I will steal it though!\"\n\n*Homie glances back towards the gem then back to Bob, and he takes a deep breath*\n\n*I am very worried he will hurt me with that sword*\n\n*Homie leans back and relaxes*\n\n*He clears his throat*\n\n\"So, do you have a family? It is okay if you do not want to talk about it.\" *Homie says nervously*\n\n*Homie is now very scared and nervous, but he needs to continue to stall and focus on the gem*\n\n\"Well, I should take off Bob! It was nice talking to you!\" *Homie prepares to leave*\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's steal attempt: Homie fumbles the theft attempt! Roll: 8+6=14 vs DC 20]\". Bob to Homie: \"*This gnome is a slippery one. He's trying to backpedal now, but I can see the glint in his eye. He's still planning something. I need to keep the pressure on and make sure he knows I'm not buying his act. I will attempt to make a Persuasion check to kick him out, as that will protect the gem.*\n\n*Bob stands his ground, his hand still resting on the hilt of his sword.*\n\n\"Homie, I appreciate the... honesty, I guess,\" *Bob says, his voice still firm. He leans in slightly, lowering his voice.* \"But I've got a feeling about you, and it's not a good one. I protect my tavern and those inside it. And right now, that includes protecting that gem.\"\n\n\n\n*Bob stares intently at Homie, his gaze unwavering. He's trying to convey that he knows Homie is up to no good, and that he's not afraid to take action.*\n\n\"Look, I'm not going to accuse you of anything outright,\" *Bob continues, his voice softening slightly. He takes a step back, giving Homie a bit more space.* \"But I think it's best if you move on. Enjoy the rest of your night elsewhere.\"\n\n*Bob gestures towards the door with his free hand, but his eyes remain fixed on Homie.

For... purely hygienic reasons, of course.\"\n\n*I give Bob a wide, innocent-ish smile.*\n\n\"New gemstones in town, you say? Ooh, where?\" *I feign excitement, trying to make it seem like that's what I'm really interested in.* \"Perhaps they have some... uh... *sparkling* options that might distract from my, shall we say, *slightly* weathered appearance? A gnome's gotta keep up appearances, you know!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome is slicker than a greased goblin. He's definitely interested in something, and I bet my bottom dollar it's the gem. I need to play along, but I also need to get the gem out of sight.*\n\n\"Bar towels, eh? Why, Homie, you flatter me! I didn't know anyone appreciated a good bar towel as much as I do. I get them imported from Waterdeep, you know, the finest cotton. But I'm afraid I don't have any used ones for sale. Wouldn't be sanitary, now, would it?\" *Bob chuckles, feigning amusement.*\n\n*I need to make a decision to get the gem out of sight. I think I will place it behind the bar for now to make it seem like it is unguarded.*\n\n\"New gemstones, you say? Aye, they arrived just this mornin' at the merchant's guild. Big shipment from the mines of Mirabar, I hear. All sorts of shiny things, I expect. But I wouldn't know much about gemstones myself. My adventuring days were more about bashing skulls than appreciating sparkly rocks.\" *Bob winks at the other patrons, then turns back to Homie, lowering his voice.*\n\n\"Tell you what, Homie, why don't you go check them out? I'll keep an eye on your, uh, *hygienic* interests here at the bar. Just be careful, there's bound to be other interested parties sniffin' around.\" *Bob raises an eyebrow, giving Homie a knowing look.*\n\n*While Homie is thinking about his answer, I need to grab the gem and move it behind the bar to a less conspicuous location. I'll place it on the shelf with the mugs and dishes, partially hidden.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"gem behind the bar\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\n\n*I am hoping this makes it seem like I don't care too much about the gem while making it difficult for Homie to grab it without me seeing.*\n\n[SYSTEM ERROR: Failed to process action hide: Skill Stealth not found for character Bob]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob's trying to get rid of me, sending me off on a wild goose chase after those gemstones. He's definitely hiding something. But those gemstones *do* sound tempting... no, focus, Homie, focus! The gem behind the bar is the prize.*\n\n\"Oh, Bob, you're too kind,\" I say with a saccharine smile. \"But I'm afraid my 'hygienic interests' (as you so eloquently put it) must take a back seat for the moment. I have a sudden craving... for... *ale*! Yes, that's it! I simply *must* sample your finest vintage. After all,\" *I add with a wink*, \"a clear mind is essential for appreciating the finer things in life... like, say, bar towels.\"\n\n*I take a seat at the bar, close enough to observe Bob's every move, but not so close that he becomes suspicious.

Didn't hit your head or anything?\" *I look over at Homie with concern*\n\n*I need to quickly assess if Homie is trying to steal the gem while I am distracted, and if so, I need to catch him in the act.

Can't go accusing folks without cause, especially not regulars.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\" *Bob asks, giving the customer a friendly smile, while his eyes dart back to Homie, who's currently nursing a weak ale in the corner.*\n\n*Bob notices Homie subtly shift in his seat, his gaze flickering towards the back room where the gem is currently stored.

Gotta make sure he can't get to it without going through me.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is definitely onto me! But I'm not easily deterred. He's trying to distract me with ale and tales of shiny gemstones elsewhere, but my little gnome heart is set on that gem right there. He's moving around a lot! I think I can use that to my advantage! I need to get him moving again and then strike.*\n\n\"Oh, dear Bob, you shouldn't fret so much about a little spilled ale,\" I say with a disarming grin. \"It happens to the best of us... especially those of us who are... vertically challenged.\" *I gesture to my height with a playful sigh.* \"Perhaps I'm not meant for drinking out of such oversized tankards! Maybe a smaller mug would suit me better? One that's easier to handle for a gnome of my, shall we say, *diminutive stature*.\"\n\n*While Bob is distracted getting another smaller mug, I'm going to try and spill a small amount of dust from the pouch on my person to obscure Bob's vision for a moment.*\n\n[ACTION: DISTRACT target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure.

If I spill a drink, the bartender will turn away to clean it, giving me a clear shot at the gem.*\n\n\"Oh my, this ale is quite... potent!\" I exclaim, a little too loudly.

Didn't hit your head or anything?\" *I look over at Homie with concern*\n\n*I need to quickly assess if Homie is trying to steal the gem while I am distracted, and if so, I need to catch him in the act.

He's been a regular here for years, and I know he's got a nose for valuables. But I can't let him get anywhere near the gem. I need to be subtle about this, though. Can't go accusing folks without cause, especially not regulars.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\" *Bob asks, giving the customer a friendly smile, while his eyes dart back to Homie, who's currently nursing a weak ale in the corner.*\n\n*Bob notices Homie subtly shift in his seat, his gaze flickering towards the back room where the gem is currently stored. That's all the confirmation I need to be extra vigilant. Time to implement phase one of my distraction plan.*\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"customer\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n\"Say, friend, while you're deciding, let me tell you about the special I'm running tonight.

Gotta make sure he can't get to it without going through me.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is definitely onto me! But I'm not easily deterred. He's trying to distract me with ale and tales of shiny gemstones elsewhere, but my little gnome heart is set on that gem right there. He's moving around a lot! I think I can use that to my advantage! I need to get him moving again and then strike.*\n\n\"Oh, dear Bob, you shouldn't fret so much about a little spilled ale,\" I say with a disarming grin. \"It happens to the best of us... especially those of us who are... vertically challenged.\" *I gesture to my height with a playful sigh.* \"Perhaps I'm not meant for drinking out of such oversized tankards! Maybe a smaller mug would suit me better? One that's easier to handle for a gnome of my, shall we say, *diminutive stature*.\"\n\n*While Bob is distracted getting another smaller mug, I'm going to try and spill a small amount of dust from the pouch on my person to obscure Bob's vision for a moment.*\n\n[ACTION: DISTRACT target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That slippery little gnome. I knew he was up to something with that spilled ale. Now he's playing the innocent card with his 'diminutive stature'. I can't let him distract me.

I need to keep a closer watch on him without making it obvious. I'll try to subtly position myself to keep him in my line of sight. I can always rely on my former adventuring skills to notice when someone is up to no good.*\n\n*Bob sighs, leaning against the bar and adopting a more casual posture, but his eyes are constantly scanning the room, particularly in the direction of Homie.*\n\n\"Say, friend, what'll it be?

I need to change tactics.*\n\n*The dust trick might work, but I need to create a more significant distraction first.*\n\n\"Oh, Bob, that's quite a story, but my ears aren't quite as sharp as they used to be. I seem to have lost my hearing aid back in Neverwinter.\" *I pause dramatically, tapping my ear.* \"Might you have something that could help? Perhaps a small, shiny object I could use to amplify the sound? Maybe something... gem-like?\" *I say, winking again, feigning deafness.*\n\n*I hope this makes him show me where the gem is again, or at least bring it back in plain sight.

I must proceed cautiously to discern the true depth of their intentions.*\n\n\"Greetings, esteemed Bob, purveyor of potent potables and guardian of this humble establishment. And a good day to you too, Master Homie, seeker of… curious trinkets.\" *I say, my voice a low, resonant hum, infused with a hint of arcane energy.*\n\n*I adjust my 🤗 emblazoned hat, subtly focusing my mind on Homie. I need to understand the gnome's next move, especially after the dropped bell incident.*\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Homie\"]\n\n*Depending on what I glean from Homie's thoughts, I may need to subtly intervene to either protect the gem or facilitate a… controlled test of Bob's vigilance.*\".

Mine had a rather distinctive dent from... well, let's just say a run-in with a particularly stubborn badger. But thank you for thinking of little ol' me!\"\n\n*Bob is clearly suspicious, which makes things difficult. WZA's presence adds another layer of complexity. Time to play innocent and wait for an opening. If WZA is reading my mind, I need to think about something harmless - kittens!*\n\n*I'll feign fascination with the bell, hoping to subtly reposition myself for a better angle at the gem.*\n\n\"That bell is quite something, though. I wonder... is it made of mithril? It has such a lovely ring to it!\"\n\n*I reach out, pretending to examine the bell more closely, taking a step closer to the back of the bar.*\n\n[ACTION: SLEIGHT_OF_HAND target: \"bell\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*That sneaky gnome! Kittens, eh? He's trying to throw off any mind-readers. And he's inching closer to the gemstone. I need to be more proactive. I need to keep that bell away from him, and find a way to distract him while keeping him in my sight.*\n\n*Bob picks up the bell, holding it out of Homie's reach with a friendly smile.*\n\n\"Mithril, you say? Now, that'd be something! This is just good old iron, I'm afraid. But it does the job of calling me over, eh?\"\n\n*I move to place the bell on a high shelf behind the bar, far out of Homie's reach. While I'm up there, I can also get a better view of the entire tavern and keep an eye on any suspicious activity. I will scan the room.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"the tavern\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [7+3=10 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast and barnacles! I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But still, I can't be too careful, not with that gem hidden away. Perhaps a bit more direct observation is in order.*\n\n*Bob scratches his chin, feigning thought while actually trying to get a better look around the room without being obvious.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n\"Say, friend,\" Bob says, addressing the customer, his eyes scanning the room as he speaks, \"have you been in these parts long?

WZA to Homie: \"*The tension in the air thickens, a palpable energy swirling between the gnome and the barkeep. Homie attempts misdirection with talk of kittens, a classic ploy. Bob, bless his suspicious heart, sees right through it.
