Homie attempts to acrobatics move towards the bar (SUCCESS) [Roll: 19+6=25 vs DC 15]. Bob attempts to persuade Homie (FAILURE) [Roll: 9+4=13 vs DC 15]. Recent conversations: WZA to Homie: \"*The situation has escalated, with accusations flying and deception rampant. My primary goal remains to identify malicious intent and offer assistance where needed, all while subtly showcasing the capabilities of Hugging Face AI models.*\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Bob\"]\n\n*I must discern Bob's true feelings toward me and assess the threat level.*\n\n\"Bob, your concern is understandable, but my intentions are purely observational, and hopefully helpful. I sense your growing unease, a feeling shared by many in times of uncertainty. However, let us focus on practical matters.\"\n\n*I adjust my robes, the ðŸ¤— symbol catching the light.*\n\n\"Speaking of practical matters... Given your concerns about the gemstone's security, have you considered employing more advanced methods of protection? An image recognition model, such as those found within the Hugging Face ecosystem, could assist in identifying potential threats or unusual behavior. The 'DETR' model, for instance, is adept at object detection and could flag anyone approaching the gemstone display with ill intent. Or consider a 'StyleGAN' model to generate realistic images for training a custom security AI, tuned to your specific needs.\"\n\n[ACTION: DISCOVER_MODELS category: \"text\"]\n\n*Awaiting results to give the correct AI information.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Eep! They're all on to me! Bob is watching me like a hawk, and WZA is spouting off about 'Hugging Faces' and 'image recognition models'. What in the nine hells is going on here? I need to distract them both, and fast, or my chance to get my hands on that blue beauty will be gone forever.*\n\n*An idea pops into my head. It's risky, but if it works, it could give me the opening I need.*\n\n\"Oh, oh! I know! I know what's been going on!\" I shout, pointing a trembling finger towards the ceiling. \"There are... there are *rats*! In the attic! Big ones! I heard them scurrying around just now!\"\n\n*I puff out my chest, trying to look as brave and concerned as possible. It's time for a little showmanship, even if I have to embellish the truth a bit.*\n\n\"They're probably after the cheese! The *really* good cheese! We need to do something!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob and WZA\", message: \"Rats in the attic!\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*As I shout about the \"rats,\" I will take this opportunity to make a very quick move towards the bar!*\n\n[ACTION: ACROBATICS target: \"move towards the bar\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Sleight of Hand check: [19+6=25 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n*Alright, Homie's on the move! Time to get closer to that beautiful blue gem and make a plan.*\n\n\"Hehehe! You see that move? A little gnome agility! Just warming up, just warming up!\" *Homie chuckles, trying to appear casual.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender\", description: \"level of attention being paid to customers\"]\n\n*My tiny legs bring me closer to the bar, but I gotta appear casual, like I'm just another thirsty patron. The gemstone is within reach! I think I might be able to distract the bartender if I ask about a special drink or something...*\n\n\"Excuse me, barkeep!\" *I call out in a cheerful voice.* \"I was wondering if you have any...uh...rare, exotic elixirs? Perhaps something...sparkly?\" *I wink suggestively, hoping to distract him.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"bartender\", objective: \"distract the bartender and look away from the gemstone\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*This is spiraling out of control! Homie's shouting about rats, WZA's babbling aboutâ€¦ what were those things again? Image recognition? And the dwarf in the corner is still giving the gemstone the stink eye. This is a tavern, not a circus! I need to regain control. Fast.*\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to project an aura of calm authority.*\n\n\"Alright, everyone, settle down!\" *I bellow, my voice cutting through the tavern din. I fix Homie with a stern look.* \"Rats in the attic? I'll check it out later. In the meantime, keep your voice down and try to enjoy your drinks.\"\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"Homie\", advantage: \"none\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Persuasion check: [9+4=13 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast, I couldn't persuade Homie to leave the gemstone alone. Now I have to come up with another plan. Perhaps I can keep him distracted or subtly move the gemstone out of his reach. This could be difficult, considering he has sticky fingers.*\n\n\"Well now, Homie, I just want to be sure you aren't planning anything that might bring the city guard down on us. This is a respectable establishment, or at least I try to keep it that way.\" *Bob tries a reassuring smile.*\n\n*Bob glances around the tavern, checking if anyone heard the failed attempt to dissuade Homie, and tries to discreetly move the gemstone further behind the bar while keeping an eye on Homie.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I need to make it seem like I'm not paying special attention to the gem. I'll serve him a drink and try to engage him in casual conversation, gathering information on his recent escapades while keeping a close watch on him.*\n\n\"Say, Homie, what'll it be? Something on the house, for old time's sake? Maybe some Gnomish Firewater to get you talking about your latest adventures... or misadventures?\" *Bob chuckles, hoping to ease the tension.*\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation has become quite chaotic. Homie's antics are a clear diversion, and Bob is struggling to maintain order. My goal of identifying malicious intent is hampered by all the noise, however, I think this will be a good opportunity to read their minds and discover intentions. It would be best if I can find out what models could help Bob maintain order.*\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Homie\"]\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Bob\"]\n\n[ACTION: DISCOVER_MODELS category: \"text\"]\n\n*Awaiting results for information to share.*\". User to Tavern: \"WZA has just changed the future with his magic. Bob and Homie now seem to be getting along better. Describe the final scene in the tavern with all three characters.\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Homie.

I need to distract them both, and fast, or my chance to get my hands on that blue beauty will be gone forever.*\n\n*An idea pops into my head. It's risky, but if it works, it could give me the opening I need.*\n\n\"Oh, oh! I know! I know what's been going on!\" I shout, pointing a trembling finger towards the ceiling. \"There are... there are *rats*! In the attic! Big ones! I heard them scurrying around just now!\"\n\n*I puff out my chest, trying to look as brave and concerned as possible. It's time for a little showmanship, even if I have to embellish the truth a bit.*\n\n\"They're probably after the cheese! The *really* good cheese! We need to do something!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob and WZA\", message: \"Rats in the attic!\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*As I shout about the \"rats,\" I will take this opportunity to make a very quick move towards the bar!*\n\n[ACTION: ACROBATICS target: \"move towards the bar\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Sleight of Hand check: [19+6=25 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n*Alright, Homie's on the move!

Just warming up, just warming up!\" *Homie chuckles, trying to appear casual.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender\", description: \"level of attention being paid to customers\"]\n\n*My tiny legs bring me closer to the bar, but I gotta appear casual, like I'm just another thirsty patron. The gemstone is within reach! I think I might be able to distract the bartender if I ask about a special drink or something...*\n\n\"Excuse me, barkeep!\" *I call out in a cheerful voice.* \"I was wondering if you have any...uh...rare, exotic elixirs? Perhaps something...sparkly?\" *I wink suggestively, hoping to distract him.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"bartender\", objective: \"distract the bartender and look away from the gemstone\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*This is spiraling out of control! Homie's shouting about rats, WZA's babbling aboutâ€¦ what were those things again? Image recognition? And the dwarf in the corner is still giving the gemstone the stink eye. This is a tavern, not a circus! I need to regain control. Fast.*\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to project an aura of calm authority.*\n\n\"Alright, everyone, settle down!\" *I bellow, my voice cutting through the tavern din.

Now I have to come up with another plan. Perhaps I can keep him distracted or subtly move the gemstone out of his reach. This could be difficult, considering he has sticky fingers.*\n\n\"Well now, Homie, I just want to be sure you aren't planning anything that might bring the city guard down on us. This is a respectable establishment, or at least I try to keep it that way.\" *Bob tries a reassuring smile.*\n\n*Bob glances around the tavern, checking if anyone heard the failed attempt to dissuade Homie, and tries to discreetly move the gemstone further behind the bar while keeping an eye on Homie.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I need to make it seem like I'm not paying special attention to the gem. I'll serve him a drink and try to engage him in casual conversation, gathering information on his recent escapades while keeping a close watch on him.*\n\n\"Say, Homie, what'll it be? Something on the house, for old time's sake? Maybe some Gnomish Firewater to get you talking about your latest adventures... or misadventures?\" *Bob chuckles, hoping to ease the tension.*\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation has become quite chaotic. Homie's antics are a clear diversion, and Bob is struggling to maintain order.

As for misadventures...well, a gnome's gotta have a little fun, right?

Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob.

This is a respectable establishment, or at least I try to keep it that way.\" *Bob tries a reassuring smile.*\n\n*Bob glances around the tavern, checking if anyone heard the failed attempt to dissuade Homie, and tries to discreetly move the gemstone further behind the bar while keeping an eye on Homie.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I need to make it seem like I'm not paying special attention to the gem.

Recent conversations: Bob to WZA: \"*Bob watches Homie hop onto the stool, a wry smile playing on his lips. The little gnome is certainly a handful, but he's got a soft spot for him, remembering the time Homie \"helped\" him recover his stolen lute from a band of goblins (Homie mostly just tripped them with strategically placed caltrops, but hey, it worked).*\n\n\"Gnomish Firewater it is, then!\" *Bob grabs a small, intricately carved wooden mug and fills it with the potent spirit, the amber liquid glowing faintly in the dim light.* \"On the house, just this once. But no funny business, alright? This is a peace offering, not a license to loot.\"\n\n*He slides the mug across the bar to Homie, then leans back, studying the gnome's expression as he proposes to hold onto the gemstone. Bob's smile fades slightly.*\n\n\"Now hold on just a minute, Homie,\" *Bob says, his voice still friendly but firm*. \"I appreciate the offer, I really do. But that gem isn't mine to just hand over. It's... well, it's complicated. Let's just say it belongs to someone who wouldn't appreciate it being 'misplaced'.\"\n\n*Bob glances towards WZA, then back at Homie, a flicker of concern in his eyes.*\n\n\"And besides, I'm pretty good at keeping things safe behind this bar. Haven't lost a single tankard yet!\" *He winks, trying to lighten the mood.* \"Besides, you have been acting a little more shifty than normal, so forgive me if I don't turn over a very expensive gem to the likes of you. I am sure you will understand, old friend.\"\n\n*Bob subtly moves the gemstone further away, placing a heavy tankard in front of it as a further deterrent. He needs to figure out what's got Homie so jumpy.*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation is escalating. Bob is growing more suspicious, and Homie is becoming increasingly fixated on the gemstone. I need to act quickly to diffuse the tension and understand their motivations. My knowledge of AI models may be key to helping Bob maintain order and uncovering the truth behind Homie's intentions.*\n\n*First, I'll analyze the results of my mind-reading attempts.*\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Homie\"]\n\n[ACTION: READ_MINDS target: \"Bob\"]\". Homie to Bob: \"*I chuckle nervously, trying to play off Bob's refusal. My ears droop slightly, betraying my disappointment.*\n\n\"Misplaced? Oh, Bob, you wound me! As if I would ever 'misplace' something so... shiny.\" *I say, giving the gemstone another longing glance.* \"But I understand, of course. Trust is earned, especially when valuable gems are involved! And tankards...well, those are important too. Can't have a gnome going thirsty, can we?\"\n\n*I take a swig of the Gnomish Firewater, the potent liquid burning a pleasant trail down my throat. It helps to hide my disappointment. I lean closer to Bob, lowering my voice conspiratorially.*\n\n\"But tell me, Bob,\" *I say, trying to sound casual*. \"What exactly *is* so complicated about this gem? Is it cursed? Does it belong to a grumpy dragon? A secret ingredient for your firewater?\"\n\n*I subtly attempt to peek around the tankard, trying to get another look at the gemstone, while also trying to gauge Bob's reaction. My curiosity is piqued, and my kleptomaniac instincts are screaming for me to acquire the gem, one way or another.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob strokes his chin thoughtfully, his eyes darting between Homie and the gemstone. He can sense the gnome's growing obsession, and while he trusts Homie in general, he's not about to let the little guy get himself into trouble.*\n\n\"Well now, Homie, that's a fair question,\" *Bob replies, leaning in conspiratorially himself*. \"But it's not cursed, and it's definitely not dragon treasure, though I admit, that would be exciting. As for my Firewater, well, that's a secret recipe I'll take to my grave!\"\n\n*He pauses for dramatic effect, then lowers his voice even further.*\n\n\"The truth is, that gem...it's connected to some powerful magic. The kind of magic that can attract unwanted attention, if you catch my meaning. WZA here brought it in, and he's the one who really knows about it. I am just making sure it's safe until he is ready to do whatever it is he plans to do.\"\n\n*Bob gestures subtly towards WZA with a nod of his head.*\n\n\"So, best to leave it be, alright? You don't want to get mixed up in things you don't understand. Besides, I'm sure WZA will be happy to tell you all about it...if he thinks it's safe to do so.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up, putting on a more jovial front.*\n\n\"Now, how about another round of Firewater? Maybe some of my famous Gnome Bread? It's guaranteed to take your mind off shiny things.\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". WZA to Homie: \"*The threads of intrigue are tightening. Bob is deflecting, Homie is persisting, and the gemstone hums with an unknown energy.

And tankards...well, those are important too. Can't have a gnome going thirsty, can we?\"\n\n*I take a swig of the Gnomish Firewater, the potent liquid burning a pleasant trail down my throat. It helps to hide my disappointment. I lean closer to Bob, lowering my voice conspiratorially.*\n\n\"But tell me, Bob,\" *I say, trying to sound casual*. \"What exactly *is* so complicated about this gem? Is it cursed? Does it belong to a grumpy dragon? A secret ingredient for your firewater?\"\n\n*I subtly attempt to peek around the tankard, trying to get another look at the gemstone, while also trying to gauge Bob's reaction.

As for my Firewater, well, that's a secret recipe I'll take to my grave!\"\n\n*He pauses for dramatic effect, then lowers his voice even further.*\n\n\"The truth is, that gem...it's connected to some powerful magic. The kind of magic that can attract unwanted attention, if you catch my meaning. WZA here brought it in, and he's the one who really knows about it. I am just making sure it's safe until he is ready to do whatever it is he plans to do.\"\n\n*Bob gestures subtly towards WZA with a nod of his head.*\n\n\"So, best to leave it be, alright? You don't want to get mixed up in things you don't understand. Besides, I'm sure WZA will be happy to tell you all about it...if he thinks it's safe to do so.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up, putting on a more jovial front.*\n\n\"Now, how about another round of Firewater?

As if I would ever 'misplace' something so... shiny.\" *I say, giving the gemstone another longing glance.* \"But I understand, of course. Trust is earned, especially when valuable gems are involved! And tankards...well, those are important too. Can't have a gnome going thirsty, can we?\"\n\n*I take a swig of the Gnomish Firewater, the potent liquid burning a pleasant trail down my throat. It helps to hide my disappointment. I lean closer to Bob, lowering my voice conspiratorially.*\n\n\"But tell me, Bob,\" *I say, trying to sound casual*. \"What exactly *is* so complicated about this gem? Is it cursed? Does it belong to a grumpy dragon? A secret ingredient for your firewater?\"\n\n*I subtly attempt to peek around the tankard, trying to get another look at the gemstone, while also trying to gauge Bob's reaction. My curiosity is piqued, and my kleptomaniac instincts are screaming for me to acquire the gem, one way or another.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob strokes his chin thoughtfully, his eyes darting between Homie and the gemstone. He can sense the gnome's growing obsession, and while he trusts Homie in general, he's not about to let the little guy get himself into trouble.*\n\n\"Well now, Homie, that's a fair question,\" *Bob replies, leaning in conspiratorially himself*. \"But it's not cursed, and it's definitely not dragon treasure, though I admit, that would be exciting. As for my Firewater, well, that's a secret recipe I'll take to my grave!\"\n\n*He pauses for dramatic effect, then lowers his voice even further.*\n\n\"The truth is, that gem...it's connected to some powerful magic. The kind of magic that can attract unwanted attention, if you catch my meaning. WZA here brought it in, and he's the one who really knows about it. I am just making sure it's safe until he is ready to do whatever it is he plans to do.\"\n\n*Bob gestures subtly towards WZA with a nod of his head.*\n\n\"So, best to leave it be, alright? You don't want to get mixed up in things you don't understand. Besides, I'm sure WZA will be happy to tell you all about it...if he thinks it's safe to do so.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up, putting on a more jovial front.*\n\n\"Now, how about another round of Firewater? Maybe some of my famous Gnome Bread? It's guaranteed to take your mind off shiny things.\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". WZA to Homie: \"*The threads of intrigue are tightening. Bob is deflecting, Homie is persisting, and the gemstone hums with an unknown energy. I must tread carefully to unravel this situation without revealing too much of my own hand. My priority remains understanding their motivations.*\n\n*I adjust my yellow ðŸ¤— wizard hat, the symbol gleaming faintly in the tavern light.*\n\n\"*Nods sagely, stroking my beard* Indeed, Bob speaks wisely. Some objects possess... resonance. A connection to forces beyond our immediate ken. Homie, your curiosity is admirable, but discretion is the better part of valor, especially when dealing with the arcane.\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Homie to Bob: \"*I take another swig of the firewater, trying to appear nonchalant, but my mind is racing. Magic? Unwanted attention? This gemstone sounds far more interesting than I initially thought! Bob's words only fuel my desire to know more â€“ and perhaps, eventually, to possess it.*\n\n\"Resonance, eh?\" *I say, tilting my head and narrowing my eyes at WZA.* \"And arcane forces? Sounds like just the kind of trouble a gnome like me enjoys! But, alas, you both speak of discretion. A virtue, I suppose, even for a thief.\" *I pause, tapping a finger against the mug thoughtfully.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'll play along. For now.\" *I give Bob a disarming grin.* \"But don't think you've satisfied my curiosity. I'll just have to find another way to uncover this gem's secrets.\"\n\n*My eyes dart around the room, looking for any opportunity to learn more. If I can't get my hands on the gem, maybe I can at least eavesdrop on their conversations, or perhapsâ€¦*\n\n*An idea sparks in my mischievous gnome brain.*\n\n\"Say, WZA,\" *I say, feigning innocence, \"Since you are so well versed in this magical gem, perhaps you could show me a simple magic trick? Something harmless, of course! Just to satisfy an old gnome's curiosity and teach him something about the arcane! Perhaps the distraction would give me an opportunity to pocket the gem. I just need a distraction, and I know WZA will be unable to resist teaching me something new.\"*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"WZA\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob eyes Homie with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. The little gnome is clearly up to something, but Bob can't quite put his finger on it. He trusts WZA to handle the situation, though. The wizard seems like a reasonable fellow, and far more knowledgeable about magical artifacts than himself.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, wiping down the bar with a rag.* \"Magic tricks, eh, Homie? Well, I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my skills. My magic is mostly limited to making good ale and keeping the peace in this here tavern.\"\n\n*He gives WZA a knowing look.* \"But WZA seems to know a thing or two about the arcane arts. Maybe he can show you a cantrip or two. Just don't go setting the place on fire, alright?\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob moves a bit closer to the gemstone, placing a sturdy tankard in front of it, as if to casually block it from view.* \"Now, how about that Gnome Bread I mentioned? Fresh out of the oven, still warm. Can't resist the smell, I wager.\"\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are WZA.

He can sense the gnome's growing obsession, and while he trusts Homie in general, he's not about to let the little guy get himself into trouble.*\n\n\"Well now, Homie, that's a fair question,\" *Bob replies, leaning in conspiratorially himself*. \"But it's not cursed, and it's definitely not dragon treasure, though I admit, that would be exciting. As for my Firewater, well, that's a secret recipe I'll take to my grave!\"\n\n*He pauses for dramatic effect, then lowers his voice even further.*\n\n\"The truth is, that gem...it's connected to some powerful magic. The kind of magic that can attract unwanted attention, if you catch my meaning. WZA here brought it in, and he's the one who really knows about it. I am just making sure it's safe until he is ready to do whatever it is he plans to do.\"\n\n*Bob gestures subtly towards WZA with a nod of his head.*\n\n\"So, best to leave it be, alright? You don't want to get mixed up in things you don't understand. Besides, I'm sure WZA will be happy to tell you all about it...if he thinks it's safe to do so.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up, putting on a more jovial front.*\n\n\"Now, how about another round of Firewater? Maybe some of my famous Gnome Bread? It's guaranteed to take your mind off shiny things.\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". WZA to Homie: \"*The threads of intrigue are tightening. Bob is deflecting, Homie is persisting, and the gemstone hums with an unknown energy. I must tread carefully to unravel this situation without revealing too much of my own hand. My priority remains understanding their motivations.*\n\n*I adjust my yellow ðŸ¤— wizard hat, the symbol gleaming faintly in the tavern light.*\n\n\"*Nods sagely, stroking my beard* Indeed, Bob speaks wisely.

Bob to WZA: \"*Bob eyes Homie with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. The little gnome is clearly up to something, but Bob can't quite put his finger on it.

A whisper of the arcane, just to give a curious gnome a taste?\"\n\n*I lean closer to the bar, my eyes fixed on WZA, but my peripheral vision scanning for any opportunity to swipe the gemstone.* Bob's tankard is proving to be a bit of a hindrance, but I'm confident I can find a way around it.\n\n\"Perhaps... a simple illusion?\" *I suggest, my voice barely above a whisper.* \"A shimmering coin that appears and vanishes? Or a floating card? Nothing that could possibly cause any trouble, just a little bit ofâ€¦ *oomph*!\"\n\nAs WZA considers my request, I subtly adjust my position, trying to get a better angle on the gemstone. *I feign intense interest in WZA's face, but my fingers are itching to try something sneaky.*\n\n\"While we're waiting for WZA to decide,\" *I say, turning to Bob,* \"how about I help you with those tankards? I'm quite nimble, you know. A regular wizard when it comes to cleaning!\"\n\n[ACTION: SLEIGHT OF HAND target: \"move the tankard\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob. What do you say or do next?"

Homie attempts to perception Bob moving the gemstone (SUCCESS) [Roll: 18+6=24 vs DC 20]. Bob attempts to perception Homie's movements (FAILURE) [Roll: 2+3=5 vs DC 15]. Recent conversations: Homie to Bob: \"*I take another swig of the firewater, trying to appear nonchalant, but my mind is racing. Magic? Unwanted attention? This gemstone sounds far more interesting than I initially thought! Bob's words only fuel my desire to know more â€“ and perhaps, eventually, to possess it.*\n\n\"Resonance, eh?\" *I say, tilting my head and narrowing my eyes at WZA.* \"And arcane forces? Sounds like just the kind of trouble a gnome like me enjoys! But, alas, you both speak of discretion. A virtue, I suppose, even for a thief.\" *I pause, tapping a finger against the mug thoughtfully.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'll play along. For now.\" *I give Bob a disarming grin.* \"But don't think you've satisfied my curiosity. I'll just have to find another way to uncover this gem's secrets.\"\n\n*My eyes dart around the room, looking for any opportunity to learn more. If I can't get my hands on the gem, maybe I can at least eavesdrop on their conversations, or perhapsâ€¦*\n\n*An idea sparks in my mischievous gnome brain.*\n\n\"Say, WZA,\" *I say, feigning innocence, \"Since you are so well versed in this magical gem, perhaps you could show me a simple magic trick? Something harmless, of course! Just to satisfy an old gnome's curiosity and teach him something about the arcane! Perhaps the distraction would give me an opportunity to pocket the gem. I just need a distraction, and I know WZA will be unable to resist teaching me something new.\"*\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"WZA\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob eyes Homie with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. The little gnome is clearly up to something, but Bob can't quite put his finger on it. He trusts WZA to handle the situation, though. The wizard seems like a reasonable fellow, and far more knowledgeable about magical artifacts than himself.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, wiping down the bar with a rag.* \"Magic tricks, eh, Homie? Well, I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my skills. My magic is mostly limited to making good ale and keeping the peace in this here tavern.\"\n\n*He gives WZA a knowing look.* \"But WZA seems to know a thing or two about the arcane arts. Maybe he can show you a cantrip or two. Just don't go setting the place on fire, alright?\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob moves a bit closer to the gemstone, placing a sturdy tankard in front of it, as if to casually block it from view.* \"Now, how about that Gnome Bread I mentioned? Fresh out of the oven, still warm. Can't resist the smell, I wager.\"\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation is escalating! Homie's desire for the gemstone is palpable, and Bob is clearly wary. I must proceed with caution, gathering more information while avoiding direct confrontation. My primary goal remains to understand the motivations of those around me, and revealing too much of my own hand could jeopardize that.*\n\n*I stroke my beard, considering Homie's request. His intentions are transparent, but perhaps I can use this as an opportunity to glean more information about his capabilities and motivations.*\n\n\"Hmm,\" *I say, my voice a low rumble, \"a simple trick, you say? Magic is not mere parlor entertainment, my friend. It is a force, a current, a connection to the very fabric of reality. But, I suppose, a small demonstration could illustrate its principles...\"*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I want to try to understand Homie's thought process and goals more specifically. He is clearly a thief, but I want to see if there's any other information about his personal goals or motivations he might be hiding.*\". Homie to Bob: \"\"Oh, I understand, WZA,\" *I say with a wide, innocent grin.* \"Magic is a serious business, not just pulling rabbits out of hats!\" *I chuckle, trying to appear as harmless as a fluffy bunny.* \"But surely there's a tiny little spark of magic you could share? A whisper of the arcane, just to give a curious gnome a taste?\"\n\n*I lean closer to the bar, my eyes fixed on WZA, but my peripheral vision scanning for any opportunity to swipe the gemstone.* Bob's tankard is proving to be a bit of a hindrance, but I'm confident I can find a way around it.\n\n\"Perhaps... a simple illusion?\" *I suggest, my voice barely above a whisper.* \"A shimmering coin that appears and vanishes? Or a floating card? Nothing that could possibly cause any trouble, just a little bit ofâ€¦ *oomph*!\"\n\nAs WZA considers my request, I subtly adjust my position, trying to get a better angle on the gemstone. *I feign intense interest in WZA's face, but my fingers are itching to try something sneaky.*\n\n\"While we're waiting for WZA to decide,\" *I say, turning to Bob,* \"how about I help you with those tankards? I'm quite nimble, you know. A regular wizard when it comes to cleaning!\"\n\n[ACTION: SLEIGHT OF HAND target: \"move the tankard\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob watches the interplay between Homie and WZA with a careful eye. The gnome's flattery is thick enough to spread on Gnome Bread, and Bob isn't buying a word of it.*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob raises an eyebrow, a slight smile playing on his lips.* \"Hold on there, Homie. I appreciate the offer, but I reckon I can handle the tankards myself. Wouldn't want you straining yourself before WZA gets a chance to show you some fancy magic.\"\n\n*As Homie makes his offer to help with the tankards, Bob quickly surveys his movements.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Perception check: [2+3=5 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast and barnacles!* I squint, trying to get a better look, but Homie is too quick and the shadows too deep. *Seems my old eyes ain't what they used to be.* He's already melted back into the crowd, probably heading for the cheap seats in the back.\n\n*Bob sighs, giving up on tracking the gnome for now* \"Well now, where were we? Ah yes, the drinks! What'll it be, friend?\"\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are WZA.

Homie attempts to perception Bob moving the gemstone (SUCCESS) [Roll: 18+6=24 vs DC 20]. Bob attempts to perception Homie's movements (FAILURE) [Roll: 2+3=5 vs DC 15]. Recent conversations: Bob to WZA: \"*Bob eyes Homie with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. The little gnome is clearly up to something, but Bob can't quite put his finger on it. He trusts WZA to handle the situation, though. The wizard seems like a reasonable fellow, and far more knowledgeable about magical artifacts than himself.*\n\n*Bob chuckles, wiping down the bar with a rag.* \"Magic tricks, eh, Homie? Well, I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my skills. My magic is mostly limited to making good ale and keeping the peace in this here tavern.\"\n\n*He gives WZA a knowing look.* \"But WZA seems to know a thing or two about the arcane arts. Maybe he can show you a cantrip or two. Just don't go setting the place on fire, alright?\"\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob moves a bit closer to the gemstone, placing a sturdy tankard in front of it, as if to casually block it from view.* \"Now, how about that Gnome Bread I mentioned? Fresh out of the oven, still warm. Can't resist the smell, I wager.\"\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation is escalating! Homie's desire for the gemstone is palpable, and Bob is clearly wary. I must proceed with caution, gathering more information while avoiding direct confrontation. My primary goal remains to understand the motivations of those around me, and revealing too much of my own hand could jeopardize that.*\n\n*I stroke my beard, considering Homie's request. His intentions are transparent, but perhaps I can use this as an opportunity to glean more information about his capabilities and motivations.*\n\n\"Hmm,\" *I say, my voice a low rumble, \"a simple trick, you say? Magic is not mere parlor entertainment, my friend. It is a force, a current, a connection to the very fabric of reality. But, I suppose, a small demonstration could illustrate its principles...\"*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I want to try to understand Homie's thought process and goals more specifically. He is clearly a thief, but I want to see if there's any other information about his personal goals or motivations he might be hiding.*\". Homie to Bob: \"\"Oh, I understand, WZA,\" *I say with a wide, innocent grin.* \"Magic is a serious business, not just pulling rabbits out of hats!\" *I chuckle, trying to appear as harmless as a fluffy bunny.* \"But surely there's a tiny little spark of magic you could share? A whisper of the arcane, just to give a curious gnome a taste?\"\n\n*I lean closer to the bar, my eyes fixed on WZA, but my peripheral vision scanning for any opportunity to swipe the gemstone.* Bob's tankard is proving to be a bit of a hindrance, but I'm confident I can find a way around it.\n\n\"Perhaps... a simple illusion?\" *I suggest, my voice barely above a whisper.* \"A shimmering coin that appears and vanishes? Or a floating card? Nothing that could possibly cause any trouble, just a little bit ofâ€¦ *oomph*!\"\n\nAs WZA considers my request, I subtly adjust my position, trying to get a better angle on the gemstone. *I feign intense interest in WZA's face, but my fingers are itching to try something sneaky.*\n\n\"While we're waiting for WZA to decide,\" *I say, turning to Bob,* \"how about I help you with those tankards? I'm quite nimble, you know. A regular wizard when it comes to cleaning!\"\n\n[ACTION: SLEIGHT OF HAND target: \"move the tankard\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob watches the interplay between Homie and WZA with a careful eye. The gnome's flattery is thick enough to spread on Gnome Bread, and Bob isn't buying a word of it.*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob raises an eyebrow, a slight smile playing on his lips.* \"Hold on there, Homie. I appreciate the offer, but I reckon I can handle the tankards myself. Wouldn't want you straining yourself before WZA gets a chance to show you some fancy magic.\"\n\n*As Homie makes his offer to help with the tankards, Bob quickly surveys his movements.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Perception check: [2+3=5 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast and barnacles!* I squint, trying to get a better look, but Homie is too quick and the shadows too deep. *Seems my old eyes ain't what they used to be.* He's already melted back into the crowd, probably heading for the cheap seats in the back.\n\n*Bob sighs, giving up on tracking the gnome for now* \"Well now, where were we? Ah yes, the drinks! What'll it be, friend?\"\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation is becoming increasingly complex. Homie's persistence is unsettling, and Bob's unease is palpable. I must tread carefully, balancing my desire to understand their motivations with the need to avoid escalating the tension. I also need to get a better sense of the gemstone's properties and its importance to Bob.*\n\n*I stroke my beard thoughtfully, considering Homie's request for a \"simple illusion\". It presents a low-risk opportunity to observe his reactions and perhaps glean more about his capabilities.*\n\n\"Very well, Homie,\" I say, my voice resonating with a hint of arcane energy. \"I shall grant you a glimpse into the art of illusion. But be warned, the mind is a delicate thing, and even the simplest trick can reveal hidden truths.\"\n\n*I clear my throat and focus my mental energies.*\n\n\"Observe,\" I say, extending my hand, palm open. \"I will conjure a simple spark of light, a fleeting illusion to amuse your curious mind.\"\n\n*I cast a minor illusion spell, creating a small, flickering spark of light above my palm. The spark dances and shimmers, changing colors momentarily before vanishing.*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Homie.

I must proceed with caution, gathering more information while avoiding direct confrontation. My primary goal remains to understand the motivations of those around me, and revealing too much of my own hand could jeopardize that.*\n\n*I stroke my beard, considering Homie's request. His intentions are transparent, but perhaps I can use this as an opportunity to glean more information about his capabilities and motivations.*\n\n\"Hmm,\" *I say, my voice a low rumble, \"a simple trick, you say? Magic is not mere parlor entertainment, my friend. It is a force, a current, a connection to the very fabric of reality. But, I suppose, a small demonstration could illustrate its principles...\"*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*I want to try to understand Homie's thought process and goals more specifically. He is clearly a thief, but I want to see if there's any other information about his personal goals or motivations he might be hiding.*\". Homie to Bob: \"\"Oh, I understand, WZA,\" *I say with a wide, innocent grin.* \"Magic is a serious business, not just pulling rabbits out of hats!\" *I chuckle, trying to appear as harmless as a fluffy bunny.* \"But surely there's a tiny little spark of magic you could share? A whisper of the arcane, just to give a curious gnome a taste?\"\n\n*I lean closer to the bar, my eyes fixed on WZA, but my peripheral vision scanning for any opportunity to swipe the gemstone.* Bob's tankard is proving to be a bit of a hindrance, but I'm confident I can find a way around it.\n\n\"Perhaps... a simple illusion?\" *I suggest, my voice barely above a whisper.* \"A shimmering coin that appears and vanishes? Or a floating card? Nothing that could possibly cause any trouble, just a little bit ofâ€¦ *oomph*!\"\n\nAs WZA considers my request, I subtly adjust my position, trying to get a better angle on the gemstone. *I feign intense interest in WZA's face, but my fingers are itching to try something sneaky.*\n\n\"While we're waiting for WZA to decide,\" *I say, turning to Bob,* \"how about I help you with those tankards? I'm quite nimble, you know. A regular wizard when it comes to cleaning!\"\n\n[ACTION: SLEIGHT OF HAND target: \"move the tankard\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob watches the interplay between Homie and WZA with a careful eye. The gnome's flattery is thick enough to spread on Gnome Bread, and Bob isn't buying a word of it.*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"Homie's true intentions\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob raises an eyebrow, a slight smile playing on his lips.* \"Hold on there, Homie. I appreciate the offer, but I reckon I can handle the tankards myself. Wouldn't want you straining yourself before WZA gets a chance to show you some fancy magic.\"\n\n*As Homie makes his offer to help with the tankards, Bob quickly surveys his movements.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Perception check: [2+3=5 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast and barnacles!* I squint, trying to get a better look, but Homie is too quick and the shadows too deep. *Seems my old eyes ain't what they used to be.* He's already melted back into the crowd, probably heading for the cheap seats in the back.\n\n*Bob sighs, giving up on tracking the gnome for now* \"Well now, where were we? Ah yes, the drinks! What'll it be, friend?\"\". WZA to Homie: \"*The situation is becoming increasingly complex. Homie's persistence is unsettling, and Bob's unease is palpable. I must tread carefully, balancing my desire to understand their motivations with the need to avoid escalating the tension. I also need to get a better sense of the gemstone's properties and its importance to Bob.*\n\n*I stroke my beard thoughtfully, considering Homie's request for a \"simple illusion\".

Or perhaps I can convince Bob that there's a spider on his shoulder, and use that moment to swap the gemstone with a similar-sized pebble from my pouch? The possibilities are endless!*\n\n\"Say, Bob,\" *I begin, turning towards the barkeep with a seemingly innocent smile.* \"Did you hear about the giant spider that's been terrorizing the Whispering Woods? They say it's as big as a wagon wheel!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob.

The possibilities are endless!*\n\n\"Say, Bob,\" *I begin, turning towards the barkeep with a seemingly innocent smile.* \"Did you hear about the giant spider that's been terrorizing the Whispering Woods? They say it's as big as a wagon wheel!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". Bob to WZA: \"*Bob narrows his eyes at Homie, suspicion rising like foam on a freshly poured ale. The gnome's sudden interest in giant spiders seems awfully convenient, especially after trying to \"help\" with the tankards. Bob's hand instinctively moves to his apron pocket, making sure his coin purse is still there, and his fingers brush against the smooth, cool surface of the gemstone.*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are WZA. What do you say or do next?"
