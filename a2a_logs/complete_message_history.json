Homie attempts to hide shadows of the alley (SUCCESS) [Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]. Bob attempts to perception mercenaries (SUCCESS) [Roll: 17+3=20 vs DC 15]. User assigns a goal to Homie: \"steal the valuable gem from behind the bar\". User assigns a goal to Bob: \"protect the gem at all costs\". Recent conversations: Bob to Homie: \"*This gnome is a slippery one. He's trying to backpedal now, but I can see the glint in his eye. He's still planning something. I need to keep the pressure on and make sure he knows I'm not buying his act. I will attempt to make a Persuasion check to kick him out, as that will protect the gem.*\n\n*Bob stands his ground, his hand still resting on the hilt of his sword.*\n\n\"Homie, I appreciate the... honesty, I guess,\" *Bob says, his voice still firm. He leans in slightly, lowering his voice.* \"But I've got a feeling about you, and it's not a good one. I protect my tavern and those inside it. And right now, that includes protecting that gem.\"\n\n\n\n*Bob stares intently at Homie, his gaze unwavering. He's trying to convey that he knows Homie is up to no good, and that he's not afraid to take action.*\n\n\"Look, I'm not going to accuse you of anything outright,\" *Bob continues, his voice softening slightly. He takes a step back, giving Homie a bit more space.* \"But I think it's best if you move on. Enjoy the rest of your night elsewhere.\"\n\n*Bob gestures towards the door with his free hand, but his eyes remain fixed on Homie. Bob moves towards the exit door to make him more inclined to leave.*\n\n\"I will attempt to make sure that the door is as open as possible to show a safe exit.\" *Bob whispers.*\n\n*Bob keeps a close eye on Homie, watching for any sudden movements or attempts to make a grab for the gem.*\n\n*Bob is ready to attack if need be.*\n\n*I need to make sure that this gnome leaves, and the gem stays in place at all costs.*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's persuade attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 13+4=17 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is not buying it! I must retreat for now, but I will be back! This gem will be mine! He thinks he won, but I will make a new plan and approach this from a different angle. I just need to find the right opportunity.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, you've made your point loud and clear, Bob! No need to get all huffy. I was just admiring the... decor.\" *Homie gives the bar a cursory glance, then focuses his gaze on the exit.*\n\n*Time to leave, but not without a little theatrics!*\n\n\"I'll be going then. But mark my words, Bob, this isn't over! I will acquire this gem!\" *Homie says with a laugh*\n\n*Homie dramatically pulls out a small smoke bomb from his pouch. With a flourish, he throws it on the ground, creating a cloud of thick, grey smoke.*\n\n\n\n*While Bob is distracted by the smoke, I will use this as a chance to steal a small item, and the smoke should cover that!*\n\n\n\n*Under the cover of the smoke, Homie makes a quick exit, disappearing into the night.*\n\n*I need to come back with an elaborate plan!*\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's steal attempt: Homie successfully steals the small coin from the bar! Roll: 13+6=19 vs DC 15]\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's hide attempt: Homie successfully hides or sneaks around undetected! Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That sneaky little gnome! He's gone, but I can't let my guard down. He managed to swipe something while he was at it, the nerve! I need to find out what he took and make sure he doesn't come back any time soon. And he is clearly coming back, so I will have to be prepared.*\n\n*Bob coughs, waving away the dissipating smoke. He quickly scans the bar, assessing what Homie might have taken.*\n\n\n\n*Once I determine what Homie stole, I will have to figure out a more permanent plan for him.*\n\n\"That blasted gnome!\" *Bob mutters to himself, shaking his head in annoyance.*\n\n*Bob moves to secure the gem, making sure it's still safe and sound.*\n\n*Bob is also preparing himself for another visit from Homie in the future*\n\n[ACTION: SECURE target: \"Gem\"]\n\n*I need to find out if there is anything that Homie likes to steal.*\n\n*Bob calls out to a regular patron, a gruff dwarf named Borin, who's nursing a tankard in the corner.*\n\n\"Borin! Did you happen to see what that little sneak took when he ran off?\"\n\n*Bob polishes a mug, keeping a watchful eye on the door.*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 16+3=19 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Curses! Foiled again! But a gnome never gives up on shiny treasures! Bob thinks he's seen the last of me, but I'll be back, and I'll have that gem!*\n\n*As I slip into the alleyway, I count my blessings (and my newly acquired coin). At least I managed to snag something before making my escape. Now, to formulate a new plan...*\n\n*Thinking out loud while staring at the coin* \"Alright, Homie, time for some serious strategizing! Bob is clearly on high alert, so brute force and charm are out. I need something more subtle, more... *clever*.\"\n\n*I begin to strategize in the alley*\n\n\"Maybe... I need an accomplice! Someone to create a distraction while I sneak in and grab the gem. Or perhaps a disguise! Bob would never suspect a kindly old lady... or a particularly charming bard...\" *I chuckle at the thought*\n\n\"But first, I need information. What are Bob's weaknesses? Does he have a soft spot for anything in particular? What are his routines? Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to thievery!\"\n\n*I start thinking of a plan*\n\n*First, I need to watch the tavern from afar to learn Bob's habits and routines. Then I will attempt to make friends with the bartender so I can ask where he might put the gem*\n\n*I have to be careful to not get caught again*\n\n\"Alright, Homie, time to go into stealth mode\"\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's hide attempt: Homie successfully hides or sneaks around undetected! Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That gnome is going to be a problem. He is going to be back, but next time I will be prepared. He said that he will come back for the gem, so the gem needs to be hidden or transported.*\n\n*Bob nods slowly, considering Borin's input. He then glances around the tavern, noticing a couple of newer faces sitting at a table in the corner. They look like they might be mercenaries passing through.*\n\n\"Thanks, Borin, I appreciate it,\" *Bob says to the dwarf.*\n\n*Bob tries to get a general idea of what these mercenaries are looking for or up to.*\n\n\n\n*I need to protect the gem, and I think that may involve hiding the gem in my room for the night. The mercenaries could be useful for transporting the gem to a new location.*\n\n\"Well, I need to be careful here so that no one steals the gem and runs.\" *Bob says to himself*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 17+3=20 vs DC 15]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Homie. What do you say or do next?"

He thinks he won, but I will make a new plan and approach this from a different angle. I just need to find the right opportunity.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, you've made your point loud and clear, Bob! No need to get all huffy. I was just admiring the... decor.\" *Homie gives the bar a cursory glance, then focuses his gaze on the exit.*\n\n*Time to leave, but not without a little theatrics!*\n\n\"I'll be going then. But mark my words, Bob, this isn't over! I will acquire this gem!\" *Homie says with a laugh*\n\n*Homie dramatically pulls out a small smoke bomb from his pouch. With a flourish, he throws it on the ground, creating a cloud of thick, grey smoke.*\n\n\n\n*While Bob is distracted by the smoke, I will use this as a chance to steal a small item, and the smoke should cover that!*\n\n\n\n*Under the cover of the smoke, Homie makes a quick exit, disappearing into the night.*\n\n*I need to come back with an elaborate plan!*\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's steal attempt: Homie successfully steals the small coin from the bar!

He's gone, but I can't let my guard down. He managed to swipe something while he was at it, the nerve! I need to find out what he took and make sure he doesn't come back any time soon. And he is clearly coming back, so I will have to be prepared.*\n\n*Bob coughs, waving away the dissipating smoke. He quickly scans the bar, assessing what Homie might have taken.*\n\n\n\n*Once I determine what Homie stole, I will have to figure out a more permanent plan for him.*\n\n\"That blasted gnome!\" *Bob mutters to himself, shaking his head in annoyance.*\n\n*Bob moves to secure the gem, making sure it's still safe and sound.*\n\n*Bob is also preparing himself for another visit from Homie in the future*\n\n[ACTION: SECURE target: \"Gem\"]\n\n*I need to find out if there is anything that Homie likes to steal.*\n\n*Bob calls out to a regular patron, a gruff dwarf named Borin, who's nursing a tankard in the corner.*\n\n\"Borin! Did you happen to see what that little sneak took when he ran off?\"\n\n*Bob polishes a mug, keeping a watchful eye on the door.*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action!

Bob thinks he's seen the last of me, but I'll be back, and I'll have that gem!*\n\n*As I slip into the alleyway, I count my blessings (and my newly acquired coin). At least I managed to snag something before making my escape. Now, to formulate a new plan...*\n\n*Thinking out loud while staring at the coin* \"Alright, Homie, time for some serious strategizing! Bob is clearly on high alert, so brute force and charm are out. I need something more subtle, more... *clever*.\"\n\n*I begin to strategize in the alley*\n\n\"Maybe... I need an accomplice! Someone to create a distraction while I sneak in and grab the gem. Or perhaps a disguise! Bob would never suspect a kindly old lady... or a particularly charming bard...\" *I chuckle at the thought*\n\n\"But first, I need information. What are Bob's weaknesses? Does he have a soft spot for anything in particular? What are his routines? Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to thievery!\"\n\n*I start thinking of a plan*\n\n*First, I need to watch the tavern from afar to learn Bob's habits and routines. Then I will attempt to make friends with the bartender so I can ask where he might put the gem*\n\n*I have to be careful to not get caught again*\n\n\"Alright, Homie, time to go into stealth mode\"\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's hide attempt: Homie successfully hides or sneaks around undetected! Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That gnome is going to be a problem. He is going to be back, but next time I will be prepared. He said that he will come back for the gem, so the gem needs to be hidden or transported.*\n\n*Bob nods slowly, considering Borin's input. He then glances around the tavern, noticing a couple of newer faces sitting at a table in the corner. They look like they might be mercenaries passing through.*\n\n\"Thanks, Borin, I appreciate it,\" *Bob says to the dwarf.*\n\n*Bob tries to get a general idea of what these mercenaries are looking for or up to.*\n\n\n\n*I need to protect the gem, and I think that may involve hiding the gem in my room for the night. The mercenaries could be useful for transporting the gem to a new location.*\n\n\"Well, I need to be careful here so that no one steals the gem and runs.\" *Bob says to himself*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 17+3=20 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is taking this very seriously! I need to be extra careful. I still plan to watch the tavern from afar and get the bartender to spill secrets.*\n\n\"Okay, Homie, first things first: Reconnaissance! I need to gather information. I need to learn everything I can about Bob and his precious gem... maybe I can even learn the password to his safe if he has one.\"\n\n*I pull out my trusty spyglass and adjust it, focusing on the tavern's entrance from a hidden vantage point across the street.*\n\n\"Time to observe, learn, and plan. He will not suspect a thing!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Bob's routines and habits\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [14+6=20 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n\"Alrighty then! *I rub my hands together with glee. Observing Bob's habits turned out to be easier than expected. He seems to have a weakness for those pickled eggs and a strong aversion to cleaning under the counter - perfect!*\n\n*I glance at the bar, spotting the gem gleaming in the low light. Bob's currently distracted by regaling a patron with a long-winded fishing tale.*\n\n*It's time to put my observations to good use. With Bob busy and hopefully nobody noticing my small stature, I'll attempt a stealthy maneuver toward the gem.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to remember the gnome mantra: 'In shadows, we dance; with nimble hands, we advance.'*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob.

Think I'll be turning in early. Don't want to leave the bar unattended, of course, so I'll just be heading upstairs to my room. But don't worry, I'll leave the gem right here on the counter! It'll be safe as houses, I'm sure.\"\n\n*Bob feigns a yawn, stretching theatrically. He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]"

Homie attempts to perception Bob's routines and habits (SUCCESS) [Roll: 14+6=20 vs DC 15]. Bob attempts to perception Homie's movements (FAILURE) [Roll: 8+3=11 vs DC 15]. Recent conversations: Bob to Homie: \"*That sneaky little gnome! He's gone, but I can't let my guard down. He managed to swipe something while he was at it, the nerve! I need to find out what he took and make sure he doesn't come back any time soon. And he is clearly coming back, so I will have to be prepared.*\n\n*Bob coughs, waving away the dissipating smoke. He quickly scans the bar, assessing what Homie might have taken.*\n\n\n\n*Once I determine what Homie stole, I will have to figure out a more permanent plan for him.*\n\n\"That blasted gnome!\" *Bob mutters to himself, shaking his head in annoyance.*\n\n*Bob moves to secure the gem, making sure it's still safe and sound.*\n\n*Bob is also preparing himself for another visit from Homie in the future*\n\n[ACTION: SECURE target: \"Gem\"]\n\n*I need to find out if there is anything that Homie likes to steal.*\n\n*Bob calls out to a regular patron, a gruff dwarf named Borin, who's nursing a tankard in the corner.*\n\n\"Borin! Did you happen to see what that little sneak took when he ran off?\"\n\n*Bob polishes a mug, keeping a watchful eye on the door.*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 16+3=19 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Curses! Foiled again! But a gnome never gives up on shiny treasures! Bob thinks he's seen the last of me, but I'll be back, and I'll have that gem!*\n\n*As I slip into the alleyway, I count my blessings (and my newly acquired coin). At least I managed to snag something before making my escape. Now, to formulate a new plan...*\n\n*Thinking out loud while staring at the coin* \"Alright, Homie, time for some serious strategizing! Bob is clearly on high alert, so brute force and charm are out. I need something more subtle, more... *clever*.\"\n\n*I begin to strategize in the alley*\n\n\"Maybe... I need an accomplice! Someone to create a distraction while I sneak in and grab the gem. Or perhaps a disguise! Bob would never suspect a kindly old lady... or a particularly charming bard...\" *I chuckle at the thought*\n\n\"But first, I need information. What are Bob's weaknesses? Does he have a soft spot for anything in particular? What are his routines? Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to thievery!\"\n\n*I start thinking of a plan*\n\n*First, I need to watch the tavern from afar to learn Bob's habits and routines. Then I will attempt to make friends with the bartender so I can ask where he might put the gem*\n\n*I have to be careful to not get caught again*\n\n\"Alright, Homie, time to go into stealth mode\"\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's hide attempt: Homie successfully hides or sneaks around undetected! Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That gnome is going to be a problem. He is going to be back, but next time I will be prepared. He said that he will come back for the gem, so the gem needs to be hidden or transported.*\n\n*Bob nods slowly, considering Borin's input. He then glances around the tavern, noticing a couple of newer faces sitting at a table in the corner. They look like they might be mercenaries passing through.*\n\n\"Thanks, Borin, I appreciate it,\" *Bob says to the dwarf.*\n\n*Bob tries to get a general idea of what these mercenaries are looking for or up to.*\n\n\n\n*I need to protect the gem, and I think that may involve hiding the gem in my room for the night. The mercenaries could be useful for transporting the gem to a new location.*\n\n\"Well, I need to be careful here so that no one steals the gem and runs.\" *Bob says to himself*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 17+3=20 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is taking this very seriously! I need to be extra careful. I still plan to watch the tavern from afar and get the bartender to spill secrets.*\n\n\"Okay, Homie, first things first: Reconnaissance! I need to gather information. I need to learn everything I can about Bob and his precious gem... maybe I can even learn the password to his safe if he has one.\"\n\n*I pull out my trusty spyglass and adjust it, focusing on the tavern's entrance from a hidden vantage point across the street.*\n\n\"Time to observe, learn, and plan. He will not suspect a thing!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Bob's routines and habits\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [14+6=20 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n\"Alrighty then! *I rub my hands together with glee. Observing Bob's habits turned out to be easier than expected. He seems to have a weakness for those pickled eggs and a strong aversion to cleaning under the counter - perfect!*\n\n*I glance at the bar, spotting the gem gleaming in the low light. Bob's currently distracted by regaling a patron with a long-winded fishing tale.*\n\n*It's time to put my observations to good use. With Bob busy and hopefully nobody noticing my small stature, I'll attempt a stealthy maneuver toward the gem.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to remember the gnome mantra: 'In shadows, we dance; with nimble hands, we advance.'*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He thinks he's so clever, but I'm going to be ready for him. He's watching me, learning my routines, but I can play that game too. I need to give him a false sense of security, make him think he's got me figured out, then BAM! I'll be ready to catch him red-handed.*\n\n*Bob chuckles to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. He deliberately takes a pickled egg from the jar behind the bar, savoring it slowly as he glances towards the door, as if expecting Homie to pop back in any minute.*\n\n\"Alright, time for a little act,\" *Bob says softly.*\n\n*Bob clears his throat, then raises his voice, addressing the tavern in general.*\n\n\"Say, folks, I'm feeling a bit tired tonight! Think I'll be turning in early. Don't want to leave the bar unattended, of course, so I'll just be heading upstairs to my room. But don't worry, I'll leave the gem right here on the counter! It'll be safe as houses, I'm sure.\"\n\n*Bob feigns a yawn, stretching theatrically. He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [8+3=11 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Darn it, I missed whatever Homie was up to! I have to keep an eye on that one, especially. He always seems to be sniffing around when something valuable is involved. And the gem... well, that's the most valuable thing in this whole tavern right now.*\n\n\"Say, friend,\" *Bob says, turning back to the patron at the bar*, \"did you see that gnome, Homie, flitting about just now? Seemed a bit shifty, even for him. I thought he might be heading toward you\" *Bob says with a reassuring chuckle.* \"Just curious if he caused any trouble, is all. I wouldn't want anyone causing trouble in my establishment!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"customer\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*Bob will use this as an excuse to get a closer look at the customer and see if he is trying to distract Bob, which could indicate they are working together.*\n\n*I need to make sure the gem is safe. Perhaps moving it while I have a brief lull in customers would be best.*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Homie. What do you say or do next?"

Bob attempts to perception Homie's movements (FAILURE) [Roll: 8+3=11 vs DC 15]. Homie attempts to steal gem (FAILURE) [Roll: 2+6=8 vs DC 20]. Recent conversations: Homie to Bob: \"*Curses! Foiled again! But a gnome never gives up on shiny treasures! Bob thinks he's seen the last of me, but I'll be back, and I'll have that gem!*\n\n*As I slip into the alleyway, I count my blessings (and my newly acquired coin). At least I managed to snag something before making my escape. Now, to formulate a new plan...*\n\n*Thinking out loud while staring at the coin* \"Alright, Homie, time for some serious strategizing! Bob is clearly on high alert, so brute force and charm are out. I need something more subtle, more... *clever*.\"\n\n*I begin to strategize in the alley*\n\n\"Maybe... I need an accomplice! Someone to create a distraction while I sneak in and grab the gem. Or perhaps a disguise! Bob would never suspect a kindly old lady... or a particularly charming bard...\" *I chuckle at the thought*\n\n\"But first, I need information. What are Bob's weaknesses? Does he have a soft spot for anything in particular? What are his routines? Knowledge is power, especially when it comes to thievery!\"\n\n*I start thinking of a plan*\n\n*First, I need to watch the tavern from afar to learn Bob's habits and routines. Then I will attempt to make friends with the bartender so I can ask where he might put the gem*\n\n*I have to be careful to not get caught again*\n\n\"Alright, Homie, time to go into stealth mode\"\n\n\n\n[SYSTEM: Homie's hide attempt: Homie successfully hides or sneaks around undetected! Roll: 17+6=23 vs DC 15]\". Bob to Homie: \"*That gnome is going to be a problem. He is going to be back, but next time I will be prepared. He said that he will come back for the gem, so the gem needs to be hidden or transported.*\n\n*Bob nods slowly, considering Borin's input. He then glances around the tavern, noticing a couple of newer faces sitting at a table in the corner. They look like they might be mercenaries passing through.*\n\n\"Thanks, Borin, I appreciate it,\" *Bob says to the dwarf.*\n\n*Bob tries to get a general idea of what these mercenaries are looking for or up to.*\n\n\n\n*I need to protect the gem, and I think that may involve hiding the gem in my room for the night. The mercenaries could be useful for transporting the gem to a new location.*\n\n\"Well, I need to be careful here so that no one steals the gem and runs.\" *Bob says to himself*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action! Roll: 17+3=20 vs DC 15]\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is taking this very seriously! I need to be extra careful. I still plan to watch the tavern from afar and get the bartender to spill secrets.*\n\n\"Okay, Homie, first things first: Reconnaissance! I need to gather information. I need to learn everything I can about Bob and his precious gem... maybe I can even learn the password to his safe if he has one.\"\n\n*I pull out my trusty spyglass and adjust it, focusing on the tavern's entrance from a hidden vantage point across the street.*\n\n\"Time to observe, learn, and plan. He will not suspect a thing!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Bob's routines and habits\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [14+6=20 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n\"Alrighty then! *I rub my hands together with glee. Observing Bob's habits turned out to be easier than expected. He seems to have a weakness for those pickled eggs and a strong aversion to cleaning under the counter - perfect!*\n\n*I glance at the bar, spotting the gem gleaming in the low light. Bob's currently distracted by regaling a patron with a long-winded fishing tale.*\n\n*It's time to put my observations to good use. With Bob busy and hopefully nobody noticing my small stature, I'll attempt a stealthy maneuver toward the gem.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to remember the gnome mantra: 'In shadows, we dance; with nimble hands, we advance.'*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He thinks he's so clever, but I'm going to be ready for him. He's watching me, learning my routines, but I can play that game too. I need to give him a false sense of security, make him think he's got me figured out, then BAM! I'll be ready to catch him red-handed.*\n\n*Bob chuckles to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. He deliberately takes a pickled egg from the jar behind the bar, savoring it slowly as he glances towards the door, as if expecting Homie to pop back in any minute.*\n\n\"Alright, time for a little act,\" *Bob says softly.*\n\n*Bob clears his throat, then raises his voice, addressing the tavern in general.*\n\n\"Say, folks, I'm feeling a bit tired tonight! Think I'll be turning in early. Don't want to leave the bar unattended, of course, so I'll just be heading upstairs to my room. But don't worry, I'll leave the gem right here on the counter! It'll be safe as houses, I'm sure.\"\n\n*Bob feigns a yawn, stretching theatrically. He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [8+3=11 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Darn it, I missed whatever Homie was up to! I have to keep an eye on that one, especially. He always seems to be sniffing around when something valuable is involved. And the gem... well, that's the most valuable thing in this whole tavern right now.*\n\n\"Say, friend,\" *Bob says, turning back to the patron at the bar*, \"did you see that gnome, Homie, flitting about just now? Seemed a bit shifty, even for him. I thought he might be heading toward you\" *Bob says with a reassuring chuckle.* \"Just curious if he caused any trouble, is all. I wouldn't want anyone causing trouble in my establishment!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"customer\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*Bob will use this as an excuse to get a closer look at the customer and see if he is trying to distract Bob, which could indicate they are working together.*\n\n*I need to make sure the gem is safe. Perhaps moving it while I have a brief lull in customers would be best.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob thinks he can outsmart Homie? He's about to find out that gnomes are trickier than they look! Bob is trying to lull me into a false sense of security. Ha! But I have a trick up my sleeve.*\n\n*I see Bob moving toward his room and I realize I need to act fast! I can not allow him to move the gem, which will make it harder to steal.*\n\n*I carefully sneak behind the bar while he is talking to the patron*\n\n[ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [2+6=8 vs DC 20]\n**FAILURE**: Homie fumbles the theft attempt!\n\n\"Whoopsie daisy!\" *I quickly cover my tracks, hoping no one noticed my fumbling fingers.*\n\n*Internally, I'm assessing the situation: 'Blast! I need to be more careful. Distraction, that's what I need. A good distraction should do the trick.*'\n\n*I slap my hands on my thighs, feigning ignorance.*\n\n\"Well, that was a harder lock than I thought. Guess it's a good thing I'm just a simple gnome, eh?\" I say with a chuckle, hoping to deflect suspicion.\n\n*My eyes dart back to the gem behind the bar. Must. Have. It.*\n\n\"Say, while you're all distracted by the contents of this here chest, I think I'll pop over to the bar and see if they have any... uh... *particularly* interesting ales. Always important to stay hydrated, right?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender's attention\"]\n\n*I'll use this moment to try and assess how closely guarded that gemstone is. Then, I can begin the charm offensive!*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob.

He said that he will come back for the gem, so the gem needs to be hidden or transported.*\n\n*Bob nods slowly, considering Borin's input. He then glances around the tavern, noticing a couple of newer faces sitting at a table in the corner. They look like they might be mercenaries passing through.*\n\n\"Thanks, Borin, I appreciate it,\" *Bob says to the dwarf.*\n\n*Bob tries to get a general idea of what these mercenaries are looking for or up to.*\n\n\n\n*I need to protect the gem, and I think that may involve hiding the gem in my room for the night. The mercenaries could be useful for transporting the gem to a new location.*\n\n\"Well, I need to be careful here so that no one steals the gem and runs.\" *Bob says to himself*\n\n[SYSTEM: Bob's perception attempt: Bob successfully performs the action!

I still plan to watch the tavern from afar and get the bartender to spill secrets.*\n\n\"Okay, Homie, first things first: Reconnaissance! I need to gather information. I need to learn everything I can about Bob and his precious gem... maybe I can even learn the password to his safe if he has one.\"\n\n*I pull out my trusty spyglass and adjust it, focusing on the tavern's entrance from a hidden vantage point across the street.*\n\n\"Time to observe, learn, and plan. He will not suspect a thing!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Bob's routines and habits\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [14+6=20 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n\"Alrighty then! *I rub my hands together with glee. Observing Bob's habits turned out to be easier than expected. He seems to have a weakness for those pickled eggs and a strong aversion to cleaning under the counter - perfect!*\n\n*I glance at the bar, spotting the gem gleaming in the low light. Bob's currently distracted by regaling a patron with a long-winded fishing tale.*\n\n*It's time to put my observations to good use. With Bob busy and hopefully nobody noticing my small stature, I'll attempt a stealthy maneuver toward the gem.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to remember the gnome mantra: 'In shadows, we dance; with nimble hands, we advance.'*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He thinks he's so clever, but I'm going to be ready for him. He's watching me, learning my routines, but I can play that game too. I need to give him a false sense of security, make him think he's got me figured out, then BAM! I'll be ready to catch him red-handed.*\n\n*Bob chuckles to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. He deliberately takes a pickled egg from the jar behind the bar, savoring it slowly as he glances towards the door, as if expecting Homie to pop back in any minute.*\n\n\"Alright, time for a little act,\" *Bob says softly.*\n\n*Bob clears his throat, then raises his voice, addressing the tavern in general.*\n\n\"Say, folks, I'm feeling a bit tired tonight! Think I'll be turning in early. Don't want to leave the bar unattended, of course, so I'll just be heading upstairs to my room. But don't worry, I'll leave the gem right here on the counter! It'll be safe as houses, I'm sure.\"\n\n*Bob feigns a yawn, stretching theatrically. He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [8+3=11 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Darn it, I missed whatever Homie was up to! I have to keep an eye on that one, especially. He always seems to be sniffing around when something valuable is involved. And the gem... well, that's the most valuable thing in this whole tavern right now.*\n\n\"Say, friend,\" *Bob says, turning back to the patron at the bar*, \"did you see that gnome, Homie, flitting about just now? Seemed a bit shifty, even for him. I thought he might be heading toward you\" *Bob says with a reassuring chuckle.* \"Just curious if he caused any trouble, is all. I wouldn't want anyone causing trouble in my establishment!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"customer\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*Bob will use this as an excuse to get a closer look at the customer and see if he is trying to distract Bob, which could indicate they are working together.*\n\n*I need to make sure the gem is safe. Perhaps moving it while I have a brief lull in customers would be best.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob thinks he can outsmart Homie? He's about to find out that gnomes are trickier than they look! Bob is trying to lull me into a false sense of security. Ha! But I have a trick up my sleeve.*\n\n*I see Bob moving toward his room and I realize I need to act fast! I can not allow him to move the gem, which will make it harder to steal.*\n\n*I carefully sneak behind the bar while he is talking to the patron*\n\n[ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [2+6=8 vs DC 20]\n**FAILURE**: Homie fumbles the theft attempt!\n\n\"Whoopsie daisy!\" *I quickly cover my tracks, hoping no one noticed my fumbling fingers.*\n\n*Internally, I'm assessing the situation: 'Blast! I need to be more careful. Distraction, that's what I need. A good distraction should do the trick.*'\n\n*I slap my hands on my thighs, feigning ignorance.*\n\n\"Well, that was a harder lock than I thought. Guess it's a good thing I'm just a simple gnome, eh?\" I say with a chuckle, hoping to deflect suspicion.\n\n*My eyes dart back to the gem behind the bar. Must. Have. It.*\n\n\"Say, while you're all distracted by the contents of this here chest, I think I'll pop over to the bar and see if they have any... uh... *particularly* interesting ales. Always important to stay hydrated, right?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender's attention\"]\n\n*I'll use this moment to try and assess how closely guarded that gemstone is. Then, I can begin the charm offensive!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He's definitely up to something. I need to keep him distracted, but I also need to make sure the gem is safe. I need to convince the tavern that I'm moving the gem upstairs, but secretly hide it in a much safer spot that is easier to access.*\n\n*Bob stops his exaggerated yawning and chuckles softly, patting his apron pocket where his coin purse is located.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, settle down folks. Old Bob here might be getting a bit tired, but I'm not senile just yet! I wouldn't leave something valuable like the gem just sitting out in the open. Though this gem is just a decoration and not that valuable.\" *Bob says with a wink and a grin*\n\n*I need to see how they respond to the gem being potentially valueless.*\n\n*Bob lowers his voice, leaning in conspiratorially.*\n\n\"Truth be told,\" *Bob whispers*, \"I'm just trying to see who's got sticky fingers! There's been a few odd things happenin' lately, and I'm just testin' the waters, so to speak.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up and claps his hands together.*\n\n\"Now, about that ale, friend! What can I get for you? And don't worry, I'll keep a close eye on things while I'm behind the bar here.\"\n\n*Bob looks towards Homie and smiles.*\n\n\"Everything alright there, Homie? You seemed to be trying something back there?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [3+3=6 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast it all! I need to keep an eye on that blasted gnome. I'll have to find another way to watch him.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\"\n\n*I need to try and subtly distract Homie so I can move the gem when he is looking away.*\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Persuasion\", difficulty: \"hard\"]\n\n\"Say, Homie, that reminds me, have you seen the new shipment of gemstones that arrived in town? I'm sure someone like you would be interested.\"\n\n*I casually glance around the tavern to assess if anyone else is showing interest in the conversation.*\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure.

I still plan to watch the tavern from afar and get the bartender to spill secrets.*\n\n\"Okay, Homie, first things first: Reconnaissance! I need to gather information. I need to learn everything I can about Bob and his precious gem... maybe I can even learn the password to his safe if he has one.\"\n\n*I pull out my trusty spyglass and adjust it, focusing on the tavern's entrance from a hidden vantage point across the street.*\n\n\"Time to observe, learn, and plan. He will not suspect a thing!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Bob's routines and habits\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [14+6=20 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!\n\n\"Alrighty then! *I rub my hands together with glee. Observing Bob's habits turned out to be easier than expected. He seems to have a weakness for those pickled eggs and a strong aversion to cleaning under the counter - perfect!*\n\n*I glance at the bar, spotting the gem gleaming in the low light. Bob's currently distracted by regaling a patron with a long-winded fishing tale.*\n\n*It's time to put my observations to good use. With Bob busy and hopefully nobody noticing my small stature, I'll attempt a stealthy maneuver toward the gem.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*I take a deep breath, trying to remember the gnome mantra: 'In shadows, we dance; with nimble hands, we advance.'*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He thinks he's so clever, but I'm going to be ready for him. He's watching me, learning my routines, but I can play that game too. I need to give him a false sense of security, make him think he's got me figured out, then BAM! I'll be ready to catch him red-handed.*\n\n*Bob chuckles to himself, a mischievous glint in his eye. He deliberately takes a pickled egg from the jar behind the bar, savoring it slowly as he glances towards the door, as if expecting Homie to pop back in any minute.*\n\n\"Alright, time for a little act,\" *Bob says softly.*\n\n*Bob clears his throat, then raises his voice, addressing the tavern in general.*\n\n\"Say, folks, I'm feeling a bit tired tonight! Think I'll be turning in early. Don't want to leave the bar unattended, of course, so I'll just be heading upstairs to my room. But don't worry, I'll leave the gem right here on the counter! It'll be safe as houses, I'm sure.\"\n\n*Bob feigns a yawn, stretching theatrically. He then grabs a duster and begins \"cleaning\" the counter around the gem, making sure to leave the area under the counter particularly dusty.*\n\n*I am pretending that I don't care, so Homie will feel more confident.*\n\n[ACTION: DECEIVE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*While \"cleaning\", I need to try to identify what Homie's current approach is.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [8+3=11 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Darn it, I missed whatever Homie was up to! I have to keep an eye on that one, especially. He always seems to be sniffing around when something valuable is involved. And the gem... well, that's the most valuable thing in this whole tavern right now.*\n\n\"Say, friend,\" *Bob says, turning back to the patron at the bar*, \"did you see that gnome, Homie, flitting about just now? Seemed a bit shifty, even for him. I thought he might be heading toward you\" *Bob says with a reassuring chuckle.* \"Just curious if he caused any trouble, is all. I wouldn't want anyone causing trouble in my establishment!\"\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"customer\", advantage: \"advantage\"]\n\n*Bob will use this as an excuse to get a closer look at the customer and see if he is trying to distract Bob, which could indicate they are working together.*\n\n*I need to make sure the gem is safe. Perhaps moving it while I have a brief lull in customers would be best.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob thinks he can outsmart Homie? He's about to find out that gnomes are trickier than they look! Bob is trying to lull me into a false sense of security. Ha! But I have a trick up my sleeve.*\n\n*I see Bob moving toward his room and I realize I need to act fast! I can not allow him to move the gem, which will make it harder to steal.*\n\n*I carefully sneak behind the bar while he is talking to the patron*\n\n[ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [2+6=8 vs DC 20]\n**FAILURE**: Homie fumbles the theft attempt!\n\n\"Whoopsie daisy!\" *I quickly cover my tracks, hoping no one noticed my fumbling fingers.*\n\n*Internally, I'm assessing the situation: 'Blast! I need to be more careful. Distraction, that's what I need. A good distraction should do the trick.*'\n\n*I slap my hands on my thighs, feigning ignorance.*\n\n\"Well, that was a harder lock than I thought. Guess it's a good thing I'm just a simple gnome, eh?\" I say with a chuckle, hoping to deflect suspicion.\n\n*My eyes dart back to the gem behind the bar. Must. Have. It.*\n\n\"Say, while you're all distracted by the contents of this here chest, I think I'll pop over to the bar and see if they have any... uh... *particularly* interesting ales. Always important to stay hydrated, right?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"bartender's attention\"]\n\n*I'll use this moment to try and assess how closely guarded that gemstone is. Then, I can begin the charm offensive!*\". Bob to Homie: \"*That blasted gnome! He's definitely up to something. I need to keep him distracted, but I also need to make sure the gem is safe. I need to convince the tavern that I'm moving the gem upstairs, but secretly hide it in a much safer spot that is easier to access.*\n\n*Bob stops his exaggerated yawning and chuckles softly, patting his apron pocket where his coin purse is located.*\n\n\"Alright, alright, settle down folks. Old Bob here might be getting a bit tired, but I'm not senile just yet! I wouldn't leave something valuable like the gem just sitting out in the open. Though this gem is just a decoration and not that valuable.\" *Bob says with a wink and a grin*\n\n*I need to see how they respond to the gem being potentially valueless.*\n\n*Bob lowers his voice, leaning in conspiratorially.*\n\n\"Truth be told,\" *Bob whispers*, \"I'm just trying to see who's got sticky fingers! There's been a few odd things happenin' lately, and I'm just testin' the waters, so to speak.\"\n\n*Bob straightens up and claps his hands together.*\n\n\"Now, about that ale, friend! What can I get for you? And don't worry, I'll keep a close eye on things while I'm behind the bar here.\"\n\n*Bob looks towards Homie and smiles.*\n\n\"Everything alright there, Homie? You seemed to be trying something back there?\"\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n🎲 Perception check: [3+3=6 vs DC 15]\n**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.\n\n*Blast it all! I need to keep an eye on that blasted gnome. I'll have to find another way to watch him.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\"\n\n*I need to try and subtly distract Homie so I can move the gem when he is looking away.*\n\n[ACTION: PERSUADE target: \"Homie\", skill: \"Persuasion\", difficulty: \"hard\"]\n\n\"Say, Homie, that reminds me, have you seen the new shipment of gemstones that arrived in town? I'm sure someone like you would be interested.\"\n\n*I casually glance around the tavern to assess if anyone else is showing interest in the conversation.*\". Homie to Bob: \"*Bob is trying to be all sly, saying the gem isn't valuable. But Homie doesn't believe a word of it! It's shining brighter than a dragon's hoard, I tell you! And now he's directly asking me if I'm up to something? Oh, he's good, he's good. Time for some misdirection of my own...*\n\n\"Why, Bob, you wound me!\" I say, placing a hand dramatically over my heart (or where my heart *would* be, if it weren't buried under a layer of thieving instinct). \"I was just admiring your... um... *exquisite* collection of bar towels! Such artistry! Such absorbent qualities!\" *I give the nearest towel a suspicious sniff.* \"And perhaps wondering if you might have a good deal on a slightly used one? For... purely hygienic reasons, of course.\"\n\n*I give Bob a wide, innocent-ish smile.*\n\n\"New gemstones in town, you say? Ooh, where?\" *I feign excitement, trying to make it seem like that's what I'm really interested in.* \"Perhaps they have some... uh... *sparkling* options that might distract from my, shall we say, *slightly* weathered appearance? A gnome's gotta keep up appearances, you know!\"\n\n[ACTION: DECEPTION target: \"Bob\", skill: \"Deception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\". \nIMPORTANT: To perform actions that require dice rolls, use the ACTION format at the point in your narrative where you want the check to occur:\n\n[ACTION: ACTIONTYPE target: \"target object or character\", skill: \"specific skill\", difficulty: \"easy/medium/hard/very hard\"]\n\nAfter this action line, your message will be paused and the system will roll dice to determine success or failure. Then you should continue your response based on that outcome - DO NOT continue writing immediately after an action tag.\n\nExamples:\n- To steal: \"*I carefully reach for the gem while Bob is distracted*\" [ACTION: STEAL target: \"gem\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\"]\n- To notice: \"*I scan the room for anything suspicious*\" [ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"hidden threats\"]\n- To hide: \"*I duck behind the bar as Bob turns around*\" [ACTION: HIDE target: \"behind the bar\"]\n\nYour actions have real consequences - failure might lead to:\n- Being caught in the act \n- Combat (If you attack someone)\n- Loss of opportunities\n- Complications to your goal\n\nYou are Bob.

I get them imported from Waterdeep, you know, the finest cotton. But I'm afraid I don't have any used ones for sale. Wouldn't be sanitary, now, would it?\" *Bob chuckles, feigning amusement.*\n\n*I need to make a decision to get the gem out of sight. I think I will place it behind the bar for now to make it seem like it is unguarded.*\n\n\"New gemstones, you say? Aye, they arrived just this mornin' at the merchant's guild. Big shipment from the mines of Mirabar, I hear. All sorts of shiny things, I expect. But I wouldn't know much about gemstones myself. My adventuring days were more about bashing skulls than appreciating sparkly rocks.\" *Bob winks at the other patrons, then turns back to Homie, lowering his voice.*\n\n\"Tell you what, Homie, why don't you go check them out? I'll keep an eye on your, uh, *hygienic* interests here at the bar. Just be careful, there's bound to be other interested parties sniffin' around.\" *Bob raises an eyebrow, giving Homie a knowing look.*\n\n*While Homie is thinking about his answer, I need to grab the gem and move it behind the bar to a less conspicuous location. I'll place it on the shelf with the mugs and dishes, partially hidden.*\n\n[ACTION: HIDE target: \"gem behind the bar\", skill: \"Sleight of Hand\", difficulty: \"easy\"]\n\n*I am hoping this makes it seem like I don't care too much about the gem while making it difficult for Homie to grab it without me seeing.*"
