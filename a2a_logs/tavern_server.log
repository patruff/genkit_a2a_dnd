[TavernServer] Homie: "*This is a disaster! Bob isn't falling for any of my tricks. He's seen right through the clumsy act and the shelf ruse. I couldn't even pickpocket the keys! Now he's trying to lure me away from the bar, and the gem. Time for a different approach.*

*I need to change the game entirely. If I can't outsmart him, maybe I can out-charm him. I will try to be charming and move to the table, but keep the gem in sight for later theft!*

"Steady the shelf, eh? Well, I appreciate the trust, Bob, but I'm just a little guy! Those bottles could crush me! But I understand your need to protect the place. No worries, I'll keep an eye on it from here. Besides, this ale looks too good to pass up." *Homie flashes a disarming smile, accepting the ale with exaggerated gratitude.*

*He sips the ale, then slides off the bar stool, making sure to maintain eye contact with Bob. I can use this as an opportunity to be a great talker and start the dragon story again*

"That is pretty good! But, you know, speaking of steady, you look like you could use a seat yourself, Bob. You were definitely right! So, maybe we should talk about the dragon?"

*Homie carefully backs away from the bar, keeping the gem in his peripheral vision. As Bob moves him, Homie is a bit unsteady, but remains composed*

"I will do an acrobatics check to make sure I don't look suspicious or too unsteady, despite his attempt to move me! I need to maintain my innocent facade. Gotta make it convincing!"

*Rolls a d20... 16! Plus my +5 modifier for a total of 21!*

*With an unexpected display of agility, Homie manages to maintain his balance perfectly, even as Bob tries to guide him. Homie makes a slight bow as he moves to the chair.*

*Homie then gestures towards a nearby table with a flourish*

"Come on, Bob, let's continue this conversation at the table. More comfortable, better lighting, and less chance of me accidentally knocking over anything else. I am actually interested in that dragon tale! I have not heard of it."

*As he moves towards the table, I will keep the gem within my line of sight. I will be charming and move him, but also keep in sight the main goal. Now is not the time to focus on Bob's attempt to move me, but the gems that are soon to be mine!*

*As I sit down, I smile at him.*

"Maybe the patron would want a dragon guarding all the gems for safekeeping! Have you ever thought about that Bob?""

[2025-04-12T11:19:25.735Z] 游닌 Bob the Bartender -> TavernServer: Response
[TavernServer] Bob: "*This gnome is like a greased piglet! Can't get a solid hold on him. But moving to the table might actually work in my favor. I can keep a better eye on him from there, and the gem is still in my line of sight. Also, I need to keep him as far away from the bar as possible, as that is my goal.*

*Bob chuckles, accepting the change of scenery.*

"A dragon guarding the gems, eh? Now there's an idea! Though I reckon it would cost more to feed a dragon than the gems are worth in the first place! Plus, you know how dragons and gold are... they're like two peas in a pod, or... or... a gnome and a shiny gem." *Bob winks again, playfully poking at Homie.*

*Bob carefully moves behind the bar and grabs two more mugs, filling them with the house ale. I'm going to keep him plied with drinks, hopefully loosen his tongue, and keep him occupied.*

"Alright, alright, a seat sounds good," *Bob says, carefully taking the two mugs and moving to the table, keeping his eye on the golden mug behind the bar. He places one of the mugs in front of Homie and sits across from him.*

*As he sits, he makes an Insight check (rolls 16 + 3 = 19) to try and gauge Homie's true intentions. Is he really just interested in the story now, or is this another ploy?*

*Bob clears his throat and leans in conspiratorially*

"So, about this dragon... Her name is Veridiax, and she lives in the Crimson Peaks, north of here."

*Bob continues to watch Homie carefully, observing his body language and facial expressions as he begins the tale.*

"The tale goes that Veridiax was once a gentle dragon, a protector of the forest, but a band of greedy dwarves stole her hoard, and now she hates everyone. Everyone but the kind folks she trusts and who offer her gold. It's said that a single heartfelt compliment can melt her stony heart... but a single insult will earn you a fiery death."

*Bob pauses for dramatic effect, then takes a long swig of his ale.*

"I am going to attempt to get my trusty sword to protect the gem" *Bob whispers to himself*

*Bob casually reaches behind his back and grabs his trusty sword to make sure no one touches the gem*

*Bob looks around cautiously to make sure no one notices he just grabbed his sword.*

"Now, what was I saying? Oh right, the dragon. There was the time that she had to fight 100 goblins" *Bob says casually*

*Bob continues to watch Homie closely, ready to react if he makes any sudden moves. His hand is close to his sword, just in case.*

"What will be your next course of action? Does the patron truly want this gem? Does she need it? I must find out!" *Bob whispers*"

[TavernServer] Homie: "*Bob is too perceptive! I thought I could turn on the charm and get him distracted by the dragon tale, but he's still watching me like a hawk. Time for a more subtle approach. Maybe I can use this story to my advantage...*

*Homie takes a long sip of the ale, savoring the taste while subtly scanning the room. He notices that Bob has grabbed his sword. Time to change to a different action plan!*

"Veridiax, eh? A fascinating name. Tell me, Bob, this gem... is it something Veridiax might find *appealing*? Shiny objects and flattery, you said?" *Homie asks innocently, tilting his head slightly.*

*I need to find out if the dragon will protect the gems if offered!*

"So, with that in mind Bob, maybe we should attempt to visit this dragon? And by 'we' I mean you. I have heard that you're very good with these types of things, and it would be a great endeavor for you. I can hold down the fort for the day." *Homie says with a smile*

*Homie feigns interest in the story, while his mind races, planning his next move. If this works, he will have time alone to steal the gem!*

"Well, the thing is, maybe the owner isn't that trustworthy! Maybe we can take this gem to someone who is more trustworthy! What about that Bob!?" *Homie says*

"Just humor me Bob. How big is this gem?" *Homie asks inquisitively*

*I need to assess the gem, while also not being super direct*

*Homie leans forward conspiratorially.*

"And about those goblins... were they after anything in particular? Shiny gems, perhaps? Or just a good fight?"

*While Bob is distracted with the story, I will try to subtly move a chair in the direction of the exit, so when Bob turns back to the Bar, I can then make a run for it!*

*I'll make a Sleight of Hand check for this.*

*Rolls a d20... 18! Plus my +6 modifier for a total of 24!*

*I have successfully moved the chair without being noticed*

*Homie smiles slyly*

"Oh, the gems... If only I could get my hands on them for my own personal collection *Homie thinks to himself*"

*I need to make it seem like I am still on the dragon tale path, but also get the idea across that I really, really want to steal Bob. This way Bob does not notice that my true goal is getting him*

"I will attempt to casually get closer to Bob by asking how his family is doing, because if his family needs money, I can then offer it to them and Bob will be in my debt!

"So Bob, how is your family?" *Homie asks casually*

*As Homie moves the chair, I glance quickly to see if Bob has noticed!*

*I'll make a perception check for this*

*Rolls a d20... 4! Plus my +3 modifier for a total of 7!*

*Well, I hope he did not see anything, because my perception sucks! Time to just hope and pray!*"

[TavernServer] Bob: "*This gnome is testing my patience. He's trying to pump me for information about the gem and the dragon, and now he's asking about my family? This is getting personal. I need to shut this down, and fast. And now he moved the chair? He may be attempting to run.*

*Bob takes a deep breath, trying to maintain his composure.*

"Homie, I appreciate your interest in the story, I truly do," *Bob says, his voice taking on a sterner tone, while casually moving to adjust his sword, making sure it is visible to Homie*. "But I'm a bit weary. It's been a long day, and I've got a tavern to run. I will humor your questions though."

*Bob pauses, narrowing his eyes slightly.*

"To answer your questions: yes, the gem is quite large, about the size of a gnome's head. And yes, the goblins were after anything shiny they could get their grubby little hands on."

*Bob leans forward, placing his hands on the table*

"But enough about dragons and goblins, Homie. Let's talk about you. What's *your* interest in all of this? You're asking an awful lot of questions about a gem that doesn't belong to you." *Bob glances at the exit and back to Homie to see if he is thinking about making a run for it*

*Bob then looks in the distance to gather himself*

"And as for my family, they're fine, thank you for asking. Though I do not understand the need for you to know." *Bob says calmly*

*Bob reaches for his mug and takes a long drink, never breaking eye contact with Homie. It is time for a show of dominance to maintain the gem's protection and make sure the gem is not stolen. He can feel Homie's true colors, and if he asks about his family, it is too far.*

*I need to try and intimidate Homie into ceasing his inquiries and keep him from getting closer to the exit, and focus on the gem. I am going to stand up and attempt to make myself seem larger and make sure that he stays right where he is and does not move*

*Bob stands up slowly, towering over Homie slightly. He makes an Intimidation check (rolls 17 + 2 = 19)*

"Now, I'm going to ask you nicely, Homie. Are you planning anything or are you going to leave?" *Bob says sternly*

*Bob grabs his sword as he stands up, to intimidate him.*

*Bob is at the ready to fight or call the guards if anything happens.*

*Bob needs to protect the mug.*"
