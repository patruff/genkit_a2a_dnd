I sidle closer to the bar, pretending to be interested in the drinks on offer.*\n\n*I glance around, making sure no one is watching me too closely. The bartender seems busy polishing glasses, and the other patrons are engrossed in their conversations.*\n\n*Time to put my plan into action. I'll need to create a diversion, something that will draw the bartender's attention away from the gemstone for a few precious seconds.*\n\n\"Excuse me, barkeep!\" I call out in a slightly louder than necessary voice. \"Is that a *giant rat* I see scurrying behind your barrel? I'd hate for it to get into your fine spirits!\"\n\n*I point dramatically towards a stack of barrels near the back of the bar, hoping to create a moment of panic and distraction.

I need to play this carefully. The gemstone is missing! Need to find the gem and accuse Homie of stealing it.*\n\n\"A rat, you say, Homie?\" *Bob squints, trying to remember if he's seen any sign of vermin lately.* \"Now, that's not something we take lightly here at The Tipsy Gnome. Health codes and all that.\"\n\n*He glances around the bar, feigning concern, but really he's trying to get a better read on everyone's reactions, especially Homie's.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's face\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\nðŸŽ² Perception check: [12+3=15 vs DC 15]\n**SUCCESS**: Bob successfully performs the action!\n\n*I successfully perceived Homie's face.

If so, I'll need to be extra vigilant tonight.*\n\n\"Well now, today we've got quite the selection! We've got our house ale, The Tipsy Brew - that's a copper-colored beauty with a hint of honey. Then there's Dwarven Stout from the northern mountains, dark and rich that one. For something lighter, I've got Elven Sunburst, a pale ale with a touch of citrus.\"\n\n*He leans in a bit closer, preparing to study the customer's expressions as he mentions the expensive option*\n\n[ACTION: INSIGHT target: \"customer's reaction\", skill: \"Insight\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n\"And for those with coin to spare, I just tapped a rare keg of Dragonfire Whiskey. Not for the faint of heart, mind you! Burns going down but warms you up proper. Costs five gold pieces a glass - quite steep, but worth every copper for those who appreciate fine spirits.\"\n\n*Bob casually wipes the counter, positioning himself to see if the customer glances toward anyone else in the tavern before answering - a possible sign of seeking approval before spending guild money. Seeing Homie enter, Bob discreetly turns to polish glasses behind the bar, subtly keeping an eye on the gnome in the reflection.*\n\n*I need to make sure the gemstone is secure, and this might be a good time to subtly check on it. I'll feign needing something from under the bar.*\n\n[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: \"Homie's movements\", skill: \"Perception\", difficulty: \"medium\"]\n\n*Bob ducks down behind the bar, pretending to look for a specific type of mug, but instead, he's quickly glancing at the hidden compartment where he keeps the gemstone, just to ensure it's still there and undisturbed.*\n\n\"What'll it be, friend?\"\".

I need to distract Bob somehow, get him thinking about something else. And WZA, that wizard is looking at me like he knows I stole it. Maybe I can turn Bob's suspicion towards WZA.*\n\n\"Say, Bob, you don't think... WZA conjured up a rat, do you?

WZA, I appreciate yourâ€¦ colorfulâ€¦ interpretations, but I doubt you conjured a rat.
