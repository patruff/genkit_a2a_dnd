And appropriately named, eh? *chuckles* I'll take a tankard of your finest gnomish ale, friend! And perhaps... *eyes dart around the room, taking in the patrons and their belongings* ...perhaps a little look around while I wait. Just stretching my legs, you understand! Wouldn't want them to get cramped, being a gnome and all. \"\n\n*Homie subtly begins to assess the room. He's looking for a mark - someone with a loose coin purse, an unattended valuable, or perhaps someone who just looks ripe for a bit of harmless trickery. He takes a sip of the ale, savoring the taste as his eyes continue to scan.*\n\n\"Say, barkeep, you wouldn't happen to know if there are any interesting games of chance happening around here tonight, would you? Or perhaps... any juicy rumors floating about?\" *Homie gives the barkeep a disarming, innocent smile* \"A little gnome like me needs some entertainment, you see!\"",

Tankard of gnomish ale coming right up.\"\n\n*Bob fills a tankard with a frothy, amber-colored ale and slides it across the bar to Homie.*\n\n\"Now, as for games of chance... Old Man Fitzwilliam usually has a dice game going in the back corner on evenings like this, but I wouldn't bet the shirt off your back, mind you. He's got loaded dice, everyone knows it, but he's part of the charm of the place.\"\n\n*Bob leans in slightly, lowering his voice.*\n\n\"And rumors? Well, word on the street is that the merchant caravan from Silverwood was attacked on the Old Forest Road. Goblins, they say. Nasty business, that. Folks are saying the road's not safe for travel anymore. Could drive up prices on goods, that's for sure.\"\n\n*Bob gives Homie a knowing look.*\n\n\"Just be careful where you stretch those little legs of yours, Homie. Wouldn't want you getting into any trouble now, would we?\" *Bob winks.* \"This is a friendly place, but even friendly places have their limits, if you catch my drift.\"\n\n*Bob grabs a rag and heads down to the end of the bar to serve another customer*",

Never!\" *He chuckles softly to himself.* \"But a little... *opportunity*... is always welcome.\"\n\n*He finishes his ale, then hops off the barstool, his eyes twinkling with mischief.*\n\n\"Well, Bob, much obliged for the drink and the information!

And maybe... just *maybe*... see if those goblins left anything interesting behind on the Old Forest Road.\"\n\n*Homie strolls casually towards the back corner of the tavern, where he suspects Old Man Fitzwilliam is holding court. As he walks, his fingers lightly brush against the pouches and pockets of the patrons, his senses alert for any sign of easy pickings.
