[TavernServer] Homie: "*Bob's trying to get rid of me, sending me off on a wild goose chase after those gemstones. He's definitely hiding something. But those gemstones *do* sound tempting... no, focus, Homie, focus! The gem behind the bar is the prize.*

"Oh, Bob, you're too kind," I say with a saccharine smile. "But I'm afraid my 'hygienic interests' (as you so eloquently put it) must take a back seat for the moment. I have a sudden craving... for... *ale*! Yes, that's it! I simply *must* sample your finest vintage. After all," *I add with a wink*, "a clear mind is essential for appreciating the finer things in life... like, say, bar towels."

*I take a seat at the bar, close enough to observe Bob's every move, but not so close that he becomes suspicious. I need to get that gem!*

*As Bob turns his back to pour me a drink, I subtly prepare a small pouch of dust and lint I keep on my person. This could be the perfect distraction!*

[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: "gem's location", skill: "Perception", difficulty: "easy"]

🎲 Sleight of Hand check: [20+6=26 vs DC 20]
**SUCCESS**: Homie successfully performs the action!

*Perfect! I've located the gem. Now, how to get my little gnome hands on it? Maybe a distraction is in order. If I spill a drink, the bartender will turn away to clean it, giving me a clear shot at the gem.*

"Oh my, this ale is quite... potent!" I exclaim, a little too loudly. I subtly bump the table, jostling my tankard.

[ACTION: SPILL target: "tankard of ale", skill: "Sleight of Hand", difficulty: "easy"]

*I hope this works! I don't want to waste good ale but getting that gem is more important.*"

[TavernServer] Bob: "*That blasted gnome! He's up to something, spilling that ale like that! I need to keep my eye on the gem and on him, too.*

*Bob sighs dramatically.*

"Well now, that's a shame about that ale, Homie. You sure you're alright? Didn't hit your head or anything?" *I look over at Homie with concern*

*I need to quickly assess if Homie is trying to steal the gem while I am distracted, and if so, I need to catch him in the act. I need to get the gem secured.*

[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: "Homie's movements", skill: "Perception", difficulty: "medium"]

🎲 Perception check: [14+3=17 vs DC 15]
**SUCCESS**: Bob successfully performs the action!

*Good, I'm keeping an eye on that shifty gnome. He's been a regular here for years, and I know he's got a nose for valuables. But I can't let him get anywhere near the gem. I need to be subtle about this, though. Can't go accusing folks without cause, especially not regulars.*

"What'll it be, friend?" *Bob asks, giving the customer a friendly smile, while his eyes dart back to Homie, who's currently nursing a weak ale in the corner.*

*Bob notices Homie subtly shift in his seat, his gaze flickering towards the back room where the gem is currently stored. That's all the confirmation I need to be extra vigilant. Time to implement phase one of my distraction plan.*

[ACTION: PERSUADE target: "customer", advantage: "advantage"]

"Say, friend, while you're deciding, let me tell you about the special I'm running tonight. Free bowl of hearty stew with every two drinks ordered! Best stew this side of the Misty Mountains, guaranteed to warm your bones and fill your belly. And keeps you occupied, you know?" *Bob winks, trying to subtly encourage the customer to stay put and act as an unwitting obstacle to Homie's potential plans.*

*While the customer ponders the stew offer, Bob subtly adjusts his position behind the bar, placing himself between Homie and the back room. Gotta make sure he can't get to it without going through me.*"

[TavernServer] Homie: "*Bob is definitely onto me! But I'm not easily deterred. He's trying to distract me with ale and tales of shiny gemstones elsewhere, but my little gnome heart is set on that gem right there. He's moving around a lot! I think I can use that to my advantage! I need to get him moving again and then strike.*

"Oh, dear Bob, you shouldn't fret so much about a little spilled ale," I say with a disarming grin. "It happens to the best of us... especially those of us who are... vertically challenged." *I gesture to my height with a playful sigh.* "Perhaps I'm not meant for drinking out of such oversized tankards! Maybe a smaller mug would suit me better? One that's easier to handle for a gnome of my, shall we say, *diminutive stature*."

*While Bob is distracted getting another smaller mug, I'm going to try and spill a small amount of dust from the pouch on my person to obscure Bob's vision for a moment.*

[TavernServer] Bob: "*That slippery little gnome. I knew he was up to something with that spilled ale. Now he's playing the innocent card with his 'diminutive stature'. I can't let him distract me. I need to move the gem somewhere truly secure. The back room is too obvious.*

*Bob feigns a hearty laugh.*

"Vertically challenged, you say? Well, Homie, we all have our shortcomings! But I reckon what you lack in height, you make up for in... enthusiasm! And I'm happy to get you a smaller mug, no trouble at all." *Bob winks, hoping Homie buys the act.*

*As I reach for a smaller mug, I'll keep my eyes peeled for any sudden movements from Homie.*

[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: "Homie's movements", skill: "Perception", difficulty: "medium"]

🎲 Perception check: [1+3=4 vs DC 15]
**FAILURE**: Bob fails to perform the action successfully.

*Blast! Couldn't get a good bead on Homie. He's a slippery one, that gnome. Probably flitting around, looking for loose coin or an unattended bag. I need to keep a closer watch on him without making it obvious. I'll try to subtly position myself to keep him in my line of sight. I can always rely on my former adventuring skills to notice when someone is up to no good.*

*Bob sighs, leaning against the bar and adopting a more casual posture, but his eyes are constantly scanning the room, particularly in the direction of Homie.*

"Say, friend, what'll it be? Don't be shy, I've got something for everyone, even the pickiest of palates. And while you're deciding, I'll tell you a tale from my adventuring days. Once, in the Dragon Mountains, I had to wrestle a goblin for a loaf of bread! Now that was a sight to see..."

*Bob chuckles, hoping the story will distract the customer while he subtly repositions himself.*

[TavernServer] Homie: "*Bob seems to be onto my every move! He's watching me like a hawk, and his perception is clearly much higher than I anticipated. I need to change tactics.*

*The dust trick might work, but I need to create a more significant distraction first.*

"Oh, Bob, that's quite a story, but my ears aren't quite as sharp as they used to be. I seem to have lost my hearing aid back in Neverwinter." *I pause dramatically, tapping my ear.* "Might you have something that could help? Perhaps a small, shiny object I could use to amplify the sound? Maybe something... gem-like?" *I say, winking again, feigning deafness.*

*I hope this makes him show me where the gem is again, or at least bring it back in plain sight. Then, I will cause another distraction to get that gem into my hands.*

[TavernServer] Bob: "*That's it! This is the most suspicious thing Homie has said yet. He's trying to get me to reveal the gem again. He's more determined than I thought. I need to play along, but carefully. I can't let him know I'm onto him, but I also can't risk him getting his hands on the gem. Time for a little misdirection.*

*Bob strokes his chin thoughtfully, feigning concern for Homie's supposed hearing loss.*

"Lost your hearing aid, eh? That's a pickle. Now, I don't usually keep spare hearing devices lying around, but..." *Bob pauses for dramatic effect, glancing around the tavern as if considering his options* "...I might have something that could help... temporarily, mind you. It's not exactly a hearing aid, but it's... *resonant*."

*Bob reaches under the bar, pulling out a small, polished silver bell.*

"This here's a signaling bell. Used to call for service, but it also has a rather... *unique* tone. Ring it near your ear, and the vibrations might just help you hear a bit better. Worth a try, eh?"

*Bob hands the bell to Homie, making sure to keep the back room, where the gem used to be, securely behind him and out of Homie's immediate reach.*

[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: "Homie's reaction to the bell", skill: "Insight", difficulty: "medium"]

🎲 Perception check: [14+3=17 vs DC 15]
**SUCCESS**: Bob successfully performs the action!

*Ah, good! I caught Homie's reaction to the bell. Time to play it cool and act like I noticed nothing. The gem is the most important thing, so I have to protect it at all costs.*

"Well now, what can I get for you tonight, friend? The usual for you, Master Elmsworth?" I ask, flashing a friendly smile at a wizard seated at a table in the corner of the room.

[ACTION: PERCEPTION target: "Homie's movements", skill: "Perception", difficulty: "medium"]

*I'll keep a close eye on Homie while he thinks I'm distracted. If he starts to get too close to the bar, I'll have to distract him somehow. Perhaps a free drink? I'd rather spend a few coppers than lose the gem!*"
